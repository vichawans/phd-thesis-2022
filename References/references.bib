	abstract = {Abstract. Many Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) models have exhibited a substantial cold bias in the global mean surface temperature (GMST) in the latter part of the 20th century. An overly strong negative aerosol forcing has been suggested as a leading contributor to this bias. An updated configuration of UK Earth System Model (UKESM) version 1, UKESM1.1, has been developed with the aim of reducing the historical cold bias in this model. Changes implemented include an improved representation of SO2 dry deposition, along with several other smaller modifications to the aerosol scheme and a retuning of some uncertain parameters of the fully coupled Earth system model. The Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima (DECK) experiments, a six-member historical ensemble and a subset of future scenario simulations are completed. In addition, the total anthropogenic effective radiative forcing (ERF), its components and the effective and transient climate sensitivities are also computed. The UKESM1.1 preindustrial climate is warmer than UKESM1 by up to 0.75 K, and a significant improvement in the historical GMST record is simulated, with the magnitude of the cold bias reduced by over 50 \%. The warmer climate increases ocean heat uptake in the Northern Hemisphere oceans and reduces Arctic sea ice, which is in better agreement with observations. Changes to the aerosol and related cloud properties are a driver of the improved GMST simulation despite only a modest reduction in the magnitude of the negative aerosol ERF (which increases by +0.08 W m−2). The total anthropogenic ERF increases from 1.76 W m−2 in UKESM1 to 1.84 W m−2 in UKESM1.1. The effective climate sensitivity (5.27 K) and transient climate response (2.64 K) remain largely unchanged from UKESM1 (5.36 and 2.76 K respectively).},

All models carried out two sets of simulations: a control experiment with all forcings set to the year 1850 and a perturbation experiment with all forcings identical to the control, except for aerosols with precursor emissions set to the year 2014. In response to the pattern of all aerosols effective radiative forcing (ERF), the fast temperature responses are characterized by cooling over the continental areas, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, with the largest cooling over East Asia and India, sulfate being the dominant aerosol surface temperature driver for present-day emissions. In the Arctic there is a warming signal for winter in the ensemble mean of fast temperature responses, but the model-to-model variability is large, and it is presumably linked to aerosol-induced circulation changes. The largest fast precipitation responses are seen in the tropical belt regions, generally characterized by a reduction over continental regions and presumably a southward shift of the tropical rain belt. This is a characteristic and robust feature among most models in this study, associated with weakening of the monsoon systems around the globe (Asia, Africa and America) in response to hemispherically asymmetric cooling from a Northern Hemisphere aerosol perturbation, forcing possibly the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and tropical precipitation to shift away from the cooled hemisphere despite that aerosols' effects on temperature and precipitation are only partly realized in these simulations as the sea surface temperatures are kept fixed.

Besides their direct and indirect reduction of short-wave solar radiation, the increased cloudiness and cloud liquid water generate a substantial downward positive long-wave surface forcing; consequently, nighttime temperature in winter increases by +0.7°C, and the diurnal temperature range decreases by −0.7°C averaged over the industrialized parts of China. Confidence in the simulated results is limited by uncertainties in model cloud physics. However, they are broadly consistent with the observed diurnal temperature range decrease as reported in China, suggesting that changes in downward long-wave radiation at the surface are important in understanding temperature changes from aerosols.},

	abstract = {The urban heat island intensity (UHII) is the temperature difference between urban areas and their rural surroundings. It is commonly attributed to changes in the underlying surface structure caused by urbanization. Air pollution caused by aerosol particles can affect the UHII through changing (1) the surface energy balance by the aerosol radiative effect (ARE) and (2) planetary-boundary-layer (PBL) stability and airflow intensity by modifying thermodynamic structure, which is referred to as the aerosol dynamic effect (ADE). By analyzing satellite data and ground-based observations collected from 2001 to 2010 at 35 cities in China and using the WRF-Chem model, we find that the impact of aerosols on UHII differs considerably: reducing the UHII in summer but increasing the UHII in winter. This seasonal contrast is proposed to be caused by the different strengths of the ARE and ADE between summer and winter. In summer, the ARE on UHII is dominant over the ADE, cooling down surface temperature more strongly in urban areas than in rural areas because of much higher aerosol loading, and offsets the urban heating, therefore weakening UHII. In winter, however, the ADE is more dominant, because aerosols stabilize the PBL more in the polluted condition, weakening the near-surface heat transport over urban areas in both vertical and horizontal directions. This means that the heat accumulated in urban areas is dispersed less effectively, and thus the UHII is enhanced. These findings shed new light on the impact of the interaction between urbanization-induced surface changes and air pollution on urban climate.},

	abstract = {As the global temperature increases with changing climate, precipitation rates and patterns are affected through a wide range of physical mechanisms. The globally averaged intensity of extreme precipitation also changes more rapidly than the globally averaged precipitation rate. While some aspects of the regional variation in precipitation predicted by climate models appear robust, there is still a large degree of intermodel differences unaccounted for. Individual drivers of climate change initially alter the energy budget of the atmosphere, leading to distinct rapid adjustments involving changes in precipitation. Differences in how these rapid adjustment processes manifest themselves within models are likely to explain a large fraction of the present model spread and better quantifications are needed to improve precipitation predictions. Here, the authors introduce the Precipitation Driver and Response Model Intercomparison Project (PDRMIP), where a set of idealized experiments designed to understand the role of different climate forcing mechanisms were performed by a large set of climate models. PDRMIP focuses on understanding how precipitation changes relating to rapid adjustments and slower responses to climate forcings are represented across models. Initial results show that rapid adjustments account for large regional differences in hydrological sensitivity across multiple drivers. The PDRMIP results are expected to dramatically improve understanding of the causes of the present diversity in future climate projections.},

	abstract = {For short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), the impact of emissions depends on where and when the emissions take place. Comprehensive new calculations of various emission metrics for SLCFs are presented based on radiative forcing (RF) values calculated in four different (chemical-transport or coupled chemistry–climate) models. We distinguish between emissions during summer (May–October) and winter (November–April) for emissions in Europe and East Asia, as well as from the global shipping sector and global emissions. The species included in this study are aerosols and aerosol precursors (BC, OC, SO2, NH3), as well as ozone precursors (NOx, CO, VOCs), which also influence aerosols to a lesser degree. Emission metrics for global climate responses of these emissions, as well as for CH4, have been calculated using global warming potential (GWP) and global temperature change potential (GTP), based on dedicated RF simulations by four global models. The emission metrics include indirect cloud effects of aerosols and the semi-direct forcing for BC. In addition to the standard emission metrics for pulse and sustained emissions, we have also calculated a new emission metric designed for an emission profile consisting of a ramping period of 15 years followed by sustained emissions, which is more appropriate for a gradual implementation of mitigation policies.

For the aerosols, the emission metric values are larger in magnitude for emissions in Europe than East Asia and for summer than winter. A variation is also observed for the ozone precursors, with largest values for emissions in East Asia and winter for CO and in Europe and summer for VOCs. In general, the variations between the emission metrics derived from different models are larger than the variations between regions and seasons, but the regional and seasonal variations for the best estimate also hold for most of the models individually. Further, the estimated climate impact of an illustrative mitigation policy package is robust even when accounting for the fact that the magnitude of emission metrics for different species in a given model is correlated. For the ramping emission metrics, the values are generally larger than for pulse or sustained emissions, which holds for all SLCFs. For SLCFs mitigation policies, the dependency of metric values on the region and season of emission should be considered.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Predictions of temperature and precipitation responses to changes in the anthropogenic emissions of climate forcers require the quantification of the radiative forcing exerted by those changes. This task is particularly difficult for near-term climate forcers like aerosols, methane, and ozone precursors because their short atmospheric lifetimes cause regionally and temporally inhomogeneous radiative forcings. This study quantifies specific radiative forcing, defined as the radiative forcing per unit change in mass emitted, for eight near-term climate forcers as a function of their source regions and the season of emission by using dedicated simulations by four general circulation and chemistry-transport models. Although differences in the representation of atmospheric chemistry and radiative processes in different models impede the creation of a uniform dataset, four distinct findings can be highlighted. Firstly, specific radiative forcing for sulfur dioxide and organic carbon are stronger when aerosol–cloud interactions are taken into account. Secondly, there is a lack of agreement on the sign of the specific radiative forcing of volatile organic compound perturbations, suggesting they are better avoided in climate mitigation strategies. Thirdly, the strong seasonalities of the specific radiative forcing of most forcers allow strategies to minimise positive radiative forcing based on the timing of emissions. Finally, European and shipping emissions exert stronger aerosol specific radiative forcings compared to East Asia where the baseline is more polluted. This study can therefore form the basis for further refining climate mitigation options based on regional and seasonal controls on emissions. For example, reducing summertime emissions of black carbon and wintertime emissions of sulfur dioxide in the more polluted regions is a possible way to improve air quality without weakening the negative radiative forcing of aerosols.},

Higher sensitivity is found for the longwave component and is driven by a combination of spatial variability of aerosol species and biophysical control of the underlying surface. The opposing shortwave and longwave effects reduce the global terrestrial mean diurnal temperature range by 0.47 K, with almost half the contribution in the regions of interest considered coming from aerosols of anthropogenic origin. We also find evidence of an increasing trend in the local climate sensitivity in the equatorial zone, possibly caused by deforestation.

	abstract = {Short-lived anthropogenic climate forcers (SLCFs), such as sulfate aerosols, affect both climate and air quality. Despite being short-lived, these forcers do not affect temperatures only locally; regions far away from the emission sources are also affected. Climate metrics are often used in a policy context to compare the climate impact of different anthropogenic forcing agents. These metrics typically relate a forcing change in a certain region with a temperature change in another region and thus often require a separate model to convert emission changes to radiative forcing (RF) changes.

 In this study, we used a coupled Earth system model, NorESM (Norwegian Earth System Model), to calculate emission-to-temperature-response metrics for sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission changes in four different policy-relevant regions: Europe (EU), North America (NA), East Asia (EA) and South Asia (SA). We first increased the SO2 emissions in each individual region by an amount giving approximately the same global average radiative forcing change (−0.45\&thinsp;Wm−2). The global mean temperature change per unit sulfur emission compared to the control experiment was independent of emission region and equal to ∼0.006\&thinsp;K(TgSyr−1)−1. On a regional scale, the Arctic showed the largest temperature response in all experiments. The second largest temperature change occurred in the region of the imposed emission increase, except when South Asian emissions were changed; in this experiment, the temperature response was approximately the same in South Asia and East Asia. We also examined the non-linearity of the temperature response by removing all anthropogenic SO2 emissions over Europe in one experiment. In this case, the temperature response (both global and regional) was twice that in the corresponding experiment with a European emission increase. This non-linearity in the temperature response is one of many uncertainties associated with the use of simplified climate metrics.},

Although the temperature response to these regionally localised forcings varies considerably in magnitude depending on the emission region, it shows a preferred spatial pattern independent of the location of the forcing. Using empirical orthogonal function analysis, we show that the structure of the response is tied to existing modes of internal climate variability in the model.

Since its creation in the mid-1990s, CMIP has had an increasing influence on climate research. While the principle behind it has always remained the same—comparing different climate models under similar conditions—its design and motivations have evolved significantly over the phases of the project. This evolution is closely linked to that of the IPCC since, historically as well as today, the results of CMIP have played a major role in the Panel's reports. This role increased the visibility of CMIP. Over time, more and more people started to be interested in CMIP and to analyze its results. Despite this success, the way CMIP is used today raises methodological issues. In fact, CMIP has promoted a particular way of doing climate research, centered on a single tool–Global Coupled Models (GCMs)–and creating a gap between model developers and model users. Due to the debates regarding the interpretation of multi-model ensembles and the validation of GCMs, whether the emphasis on this particular way of studying climate is serving the progress of climate science is questionable.

	abstract = {We present a new version of the Met Office Hadley Centre/Climatic Research Unit global surface temperature data set, HadCRUT5. HadCRUT5 presents monthly average near-surface temperature anomalies, relative to the 1961–1990 period, on a regular 5° latitude by 5° longitude grid from 1850 to 2018. HadCRUT5 is a combination of sea-surface temperature (SST) measurements over the ocean from ships and buoys and near-surface air temperature measurements from weather stations over the land surface. These data have been sourced from updated compilations and the adjustments applied to mitigate the impact of changes in SST measurement methods have been revised. Two variants of HadCRUT5 have been produced for use in different applications. The first represents temperature anomaly data on a grid for locations where measurement data are available. The second, more spatially complete, variant uses a Gaussian process based statistical method to make better use of the available observations, extending temperature anomaly estimates into regions for which the underlying measurements are informative. Each is provided as a 200-member ensemble accompanied by additional uncertainty information. The combination of revised input data sets and statistical analysis results in greater warming of the global average over the course of the whole record. In recent years, increased warming results from an improved representation of Arctic warming and a better understanding of evolving biases in SST measurements from ships. These updates result in greater consistency with other independent global surface temperature data sets, despite their different approaches to data set construction, and further increase confidence in our understanding of changes seen.},

	abstract = {Data collected at the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) Central Facility (SCF) are analyzed to determine the monthly and hourly variations of cloud fraction and radiative forcing between January 1997 and December 2002. Cloud fractions are estimated for total cloud cover and for single-layered low (0–3 km), middle (3–6 km), and high clouds ({\textgreater}6 km) using ARM SCF ground-based paired lidar–radar measurements. Shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) fluxes are derived from up- and down-looking standard precision spectral pyranometers and precision infrared radiometer measurements with uncertainties of ∼10 W m−2. The annual averages of total and single-layered low-, middle-, and high-cloud fractions are 0.49, 0.11, 0.03, and 0.17, respectively. Both total- and low-cloud amounts peak during January and February and reach a minimum during July and August; high clouds occur more frequently than other types of clouds with a peak in summer. The average annual downwelling surface SW fluxes for total and low clouds (151 and 138 W m−2, respectively) are less than those under middle and high clouds (188 and 201 W m−2, respectively), but the downwelling LW fluxes (349 and 356 W m−2) underneath total and low clouds are greater than those from middle and high clouds (337 and 333 W m−2). Low clouds produce the largest LW warming (55 W m−2) and SW cooling (−91 W m−2) effects with maximum and minimum absolute values in spring and summer, respectively. High clouds have the smallest LW warming (17 W m−2) and SW cooling (−37 W m−2) effects at the surface. All-sky SW cloud radiative forcing (CRF) decreases and LW CRF increases with increasing cloud fraction with mean slopes of −0.984 and 0.616 W m−2 \%−1, respectively. Over the entire diurnal cycle, clouds deplete the amount of surface insolation more than they add to the downwelling LW flux. The calculated CRFs do not appear to be significantly affected by uncertainties in data sampling and clear-sky screening. Traditionally, cloud radiative forcing includes not only the radiative impact of the hydrometeors, but also the changes in the environment. Taken together over the ARM SCF, changes in humidity and surface albedo between clear and cloudy conditions offset ∼20\% of the NET radiative forcing caused by the cloud hydrometeors alone. Variations in water vapor, on average, account for 10\% and 83\% of the SW and LW CRFs, respectively, in total cloud cover conditions. The error analysis further reveals that the cloud hydrometeors dominate the SW CRF, while water vapor changes are most important for LW flux changes in cloudy skies. Similar studies over other locales are encouraged where water and surface albedo changes from clear to cloudy conditions may be much different than observed over the ARM SCF.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic emissions of aerosols and precursor compounds are known to significantly affect the energy balance of the Earth–atmosphere system, alter the formation of clouds and precipitation, and have a substantial impact on human health and the environment. Global models are an essential tool for examining the impacts of these emissions. In this study, we examine the sensitivity of model results to the assumed height of SO2 injection, seasonality of SO2 and black carbon (BC) particulate emissions, and the assumed fraction of SO2 emissions that is injected into the atmosphere as particulate phase sulfate (SO4) in 11 climate and chemistry models, including both chemical transport models and the atmospheric component of Earth system models. We find large variation in atmospheric lifetime across models for SO2, SO4, and BC, with a particularly large relative variation for SO2, which indicates that fundamental aspects of atmospheric sulfur chemistry remain uncertain. Of the perturbations examined in this study, the assumed height of SO2 injection had the largest overall impacts, particularly on global mean net radiative flux (maximum difference of −0.35 W m−2), SO2 lifetime over Northern Hemisphere land (maximum difference of 0.8 d), surface SO2 concentration (up to 59 \% decrease), and surface sulfate concentration (up to 23 \% increase). Emitting SO2 at height consistently increased SO2 and SO4 column burdens and shortwave cooling, with varying magnitudes, but had inconsistent effects across models on the sign of the change in implied cloud forcing. The assumed SO4 emission fraction also had a significant impact on net radiative flux and surface sulfate concentration. Because these properties are not standardized across models this is a source of inter-model diversity typically neglected in model intercomparisons. These results imply a need to ensure that anthropogenic emission injection height and SO4 emission fraction are accurately and consistently represented in global models.},

	abstract = {Cloud feedback—the change in top-of-atmosphere radiative flux resulting from the cloud response to warming—constitutes by far the largest source of uncertainty in the climate response to CO2 forcing simulated by global climate models (GCMs). We review the main mechanisms for cloud feedbacks, and discuss their representation in climate models and the sources of intermodel spread. Global-mean cloud feedback in GCMs results from three main effects: (1) rising free-tropospheric clouds (a positive longwave effect); (2) decreasing tropical low cloud amount (a positive shortwave [SW] effect); (3) increasing high-latitude low cloud optical depth (a negative SW effect). These cloud responses simulated by GCMs are qualitatively supported by theory, high-resolution modeling, and observations. Rising high clouds are consistent with the fixed anvil temperature (FAT) hypothesis, whereby enhanced upper-tropospheric radiative cooling causes anvil cloud tops to remain at a nearly fixed temperature as the atmosphere warms. Tropical low cloud amount decreases are driven by a delicate balance between the effects of vertical turbulent fluxes, radiative cooling, large-scale subsidence, and lower-tropospheric stability on the boundary-layer moisture budget. High-latitude low cloud optical depth increases are dominated by phase changes in mixed-phase clouds. The causes of intermodel spread in cloud feedback are discussed, focusing particularly on the role of unresolved parameterized processes such as cloud microphysics, turbulence, and convection.

	abstract = {The Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model (HadGEM) includes two aerosol schemes: the Coupled Large-scale Aerosol Simulator for Studies in Climate (CLASSIC), and the new Global Model of Aerosol Processes (GLOMAP-mode). GLOMAP-mode is a modal aerosol microphysics scheme that simulates not only aerosol mass but also aerosol number, represents internally-mixed particles, and includes aerosol microphysical processes such as nucleation. In this study, both schemes provide hindcast simulations of natural and anthropogenic aerosol species for the period 2000–2006. HadGEM simulations of the aerosol optical depth using GLOMAP-mode compare better than CLASSIC against a data-assimilated aerosol re-analysis and aerosol ground-based observations. Because of differences in wet deposition rates, GLOMAP-mode sulphate aerosol residence time is two days longer than CLASSIC sulphate aerosols, whereas black carbon residence time is much shorter. As a result, CLASSIC underestimates aerosol optical depths in continental regions of the Northern Hemisphere and likely overestimates absorption in remote regions. Aerosol direct and first indirect radiative forcings are computed from simulations of aerosols with emissions for the year 1850 and 2000. In 1850, GLOMAP-mode predicts lower aerosol optical depths and higher cloud droplet number concentrations than CLASSIC. Consequently, simulated clouds are much less susceptible to natural and anthropogenic aerosol changes when the microphysical scheme is used. In particular, the response of cloud condensation nuclei to an increase in dimethyl sulphide emissions becomes a factor of four smaller. The combined effect of different 1850 baselines, residence times, and abilities to affect cloud droplet number, leads to substantial differences in the aerosol forcings simulated by the two schemes. GLOMAP-mode finds a present-day direct aerosol forcing of \&minus;0.49 W m\&minus;2 on a global average, 72\% stronger than the corresponding forcing from CLASSIC. This difference is compensated by changes in first indirect aerosol forcing: the forcing of \&minus;1.17 W m\&minus;2 obtained with GLOMAP-mode is 20\% weaker than with CLASSIC. Results suggest that mass-based schemes such as CLASSIC lack the necessary sophistication to provide realistic input to aerosol-cloud interaction schemes. Furthermore, the importance of the 1850 baseline highlights how model skill in predicting present-day aerosol does not guarantee reliable forcing estimates. Those findings suggest that the more complex representation of aerosol processes in microphysical schemes improves the fidelity of simulated aerosol forcings.},

	abstract = {Aerosols interact with radiation and clouds. Substantial progress made over the past 40 years in observing, understanding, and modeling these processes helped quantify the imbalance in the Earth's radiation budget caused by anthropogenic aerosols, called aerosol radiative forcing, but uncertainties remain large. This review provides a new range of aerosol radiative forcing over the industrial era based on multiple, traceable, and arguable lines of evidence, including modeling approaches, theoretical considerations, and observations. Improved understanding of aerosol absorption and the causes of trends in surface radiative fluxes constrain the forcing from aerosol-radiation interactions. A robust theoretical foundation and convincing evidence constrain the forcing caused by aerosol-driven increases in liquid cloud droplet number concentration. However, the influence of anthropogenic aerosols on cloud liquid water content and cloud fraction is less clear, and the influence on mixed-phase and ice clouds remains poorly constrained. Observed changes in surface temperature and radiative fluxes provide additional constraints. These multiple lines of evidence lead to a 68\% confidence interval for the total aerosol effective radiative forcing of -1.6 to -0.6 W m−2, or -2.0 to -0.4 W m−2 with a 90\% likelihood. Those intervals are of similar width to the last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment but shifted toward more negative values. The uncertainty will narrow in the future by continuing to critically combine multiple lines of evidence, especially those addressing industrial-era changes in aerosol sources and aerosol effects on liquid cloud amount and on ice clouds.},

We have incorporated photochemical reactions, vapor condensation and catalytic and non-catalytic oxidation on a wetted aerosol surface into our theoretical consideration. From our calculations, it is found that under daytime conditions, with photochemical reactions, sulfuric acid vapor condensation and liquid phase oxidation by H2O2 can be the dominant sulfate aerosol production mechanisms. Gas to particle conversion is expected to be an even more important pathway to sulfate aerosol formation under daytime conditions since reactions involving radical clusters such as HSO3· H2O, HSO5· H2O, and SO3· H2O are approximated by H2SO4 condensation in our estimates. Under night-time conditions, without photochemical reactions, sulfate aerosol production in general is lower than under daytime conditions and catalytic and non-catalytic oxidation mechanisms on the wetted aerosols become important pathways for SO2 to sulfate conversion.},

Most CMIP6 models, 31 of 36 models in contrast to 17 of 27 CMIP5 models, are colder than the uncertainty range of the observed anomaly, indicating that the CMIP6 suppressed warming is not caused by a few cold models. However, no clear cause that sufficiently explains the tendency towards suppressed mid-20th century warming emerges. Whereas models that best match observations exclusively exhibit weaker aerosol forcing than that exhibited by colder models, there is not a clear relationship between mid-century temperatures and aerosol forcing. Likewise, no systematic differences emerge among other model aerosol representations, such as inclusion of aerosol–cloud interactions for ice clouds in the model or the type of aerosol model input data set used, nor variations in greenhouse gas forcing or climate sensitivity, that could explain the suppressed warming. This indicates the presence of another cause, or more likely a set of causes, of the suppressed warming in many CMIP6 models. Thus, the prospect of a strong constraint on present-day aerosol forcing based on the mid-century warming is weakened, even if it is encouraging that those models that do match the observed warming best all have relatively weak aerosol forcing.},

Yet not all climate interactions are fully understood, and uncertainty in climate model results persists, as assessed in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report. We synthesize current challenges and emphasize opportunities for advancing our understanding of the interactions between atmospheric composition, air quality, and climate change, as well as for quantifying model diversity. Our perspective is based on expert views from three multi-model intercomparison projects (MIPs) – the Precipitation Driver Response MIP (PDRMIP), the Aerosol Chemistry MIP (AerChemMIP), and the Radiative Forcing MIP (RFMIP). While there are many shared interests and specializations across the MIPs, they have their own scientific foci and specific approaches. The partial overlap between the MIPs proved useful for advancing the understanding of the perturbation–response paradigm through multi-model ensembles of Earth system models of varying complexity. We discuss the challenges of gaining insights from Earth system models that face computational and process representation limits and provide guidance from our lessons learned. Promising ideas to overcome some long-standing challenges in the near future are kilometer-scale experiments to better simulate circulation-dependent processes where it is possible and machine learning approaches where they are needed, e.g., for faster and better subgrid-scale parameterizations and pattern recognition in big data. New model constraints can arise from augmented observational products that leverage multiple datasets with machine learning approaches. Future MIPs can develop smart experiment protocols that strive towards an optimal trade-off between the resolution, complexity, and number of simulations and their length and, thereby, help to advance the understanding of climate change and its impacts.},

The climate forcing evaluated this way, termed the adjusted forcing (AF), includes a rapid adjustment term associated with cloud changes and other tropospheric and land-surface changes. We estimate a 2010 total anthropogenic and natural AF from CMIP5 models of 1.9 ± 0.9 W m−2 (5–95\% range). The projected AF of the Representative Concentration Pathway simulations are lower than their expected radiative forcing (RF) in 2095 but agree well with efficacy weighted forcings from integrated assessment models. The smaller AF, compared to RF, is likely due to cloud adjustment. Multimodel time series of temperature change and AF from 1850 to 2100 have large intermodel spreads throughout the period. The intermodel spread of temperature change is principally driven by forcing differences in the present day and climate feedback differences in 2095, although forcing differences are still important for model spread at 2095. We find no significant relationship between the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) of a model and its 2003 AF, in contrast to that found in older models where higher ECS models generally had less forcing. Given the large present-day model spread, there is no indication of any tendency by modelling groups to adjust their aerosol forcing in order to produce observed trends. Instead, some CMIP5 models have a relatively large positive forcing and overestimate the observed temperature change.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and organic hydroperoxides were measured from 18 to 30 July in 2006 during the PRIDE-PRD'06 campaign at Backgarden, a rural site located 48 km north of Guangzhou, a mega-city in southern China. A ground-based instrument was used as a scrubbing coil collector to sample ambient air, followed by on-site analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with post-column derivatization and fluorescence detection. The H2O2 mixing ratio over the 13 days ranged from below the detection limit to a maximum of 4.6 ppbv, with a mean (and standard deviation) of (1.26\&plusmn;1.24) ppbv during the daytime (08:00–20:00 LT). Methyl hydroperoxide (MHP), with a maximum of 0.8 ppbv and a mean (and standard deviation) of (0.28\&plusmn;0.10) ppbv during the daytime, was the dominant organic hydroperoxide. Other organic peroxides, including bis-hydroxymethyl hydroperoxide (BHMP), peroxyacetic acid (PAA), hydroxymethyl hydroperoxide (HMHP), 1-hydroxy-ethyl hydroperoxide (1-HEHP) and ethyl hydroperoxide (EHP), were detected occasionally. The concentration of H2O2 exhibited a pronounced diurnal variation on sunny days, with a peak mixing ratio in the afternoon (12:00–18:00 LT), but lacked an explicit diurnal cycle on cloudy days. Sometimes a second peak mixing ratio of H2O2 was observed during the evening, suggesting that H2O2 was produced by the ozonolysis of alkenes. The diurnal variation profile of MHP was, in general, consistent with that of H2O2. The estimation indicated that in the morning the H2O2 detected was formed mostly through local photochemical activity, with the rest probably attributable to vertical transport. It is notable that relatively high levels of H2O2 and MHP were found in polluted air. The unexpectedly high level of HO2 radicals detected in this region can account for the production of hydroperoxides, while the moderate level of NOx suppressed the formation of hydroperoxides. High concentrations of hydroperoxides were detected in samples of rainwater collected in a heavy shower on 25 July when a typhoon passed through, indicating that a considerable mixing ratio of hydroperoxides, particularly MHP, resided above the boundary layer, which might be transported on a regional scale and further influence the redistribution of HOx and ROx radicals. It was found that hydroperoxides, in particular H2O2, play an important role in the formation of secondary sulfate in the aerosol phase, where the heterogeneous reaction might contribute substantially. A negative correlation between hydroperoxides and water-soluble organic compounds (WSOC), a considerable fraction of the secondary organic aerosol (SOA), was observed, possibly providing field evidence for the importance of hydroperoxides in the formation of SOA found in previous laboratory studies. We suggest that hydroperoxides act as an important link between sulfate and organic aerosols, which needs further study and should be considered in current atmospheric models.},

These high winter concentrations are quantitatively reproduced by a detailed box-model, showing that the winter radical pool (OH, HO2, RO2) is sustained by reactions of unsaturated hydrocarbons with ozone and by the photolysis of carbonyls. The high OH concentrations show there is significant chemical processing of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in winter at mid-to-high latitudes in the northern hemisphere where emissions are high.},

	abstract = {Sulfate is a major aerosol species offsetting the Arctic warming. Quantifying sulfate formation mechanisms is conducive to assess its climatic effects and sulfur budget. However, relevant observations are sparse over the Arctic Ocean. Here, we present observations of surface sulfate and its Δ17O (=δ17O–0.52δ18O) over the latitude of 63.3–87.7°N in the Arctic Ocean in July–September 2012 to estimate sulfate production mechanisms. Potential contamination from ship plume on the observed sulfate was corrected based on black carbon. The corrected non-sea-salt sulfate (nss-SO42−cor) varied from 0.0 to 1.3 μg m−3 with the mean of 0.3 ± 0.3(1σ) μg m−3. Samples with high contributions (≥80\%) from sea-salt sulfate and anthropogenic sulfate from ship plume possess Δ17O(SO42−) at ∼0‰. Δ17O of nss-SO42−cor ranged from 0.0 to 0.9‰ with the mean of 0.5 ± 0.3‰. The low Δ17O values directly suggest the contribution from O3 oxidation to sulfate production is minor in summer Arctic due to this mechanism resulting in Δ17O(SO42−) = 9.8‰. Further calculations constrained by Δ17O indicate sulfate production was dominated by H2O2 oxidation with the possible contribution of 37\%–66\%, higher than the estimated fraction of 29\% from OH oxidation. The role of HOBr oxidation is related to its abundance, which can reach a maximum contribution of 24\% at assumption of [HOBr] = 1 ppt in summer Arctic. Future model studies with the constraint of sulfate and Δ17O observations in this study will further improve our knowledge of global sulfur budget and sulfate formation mechanisms in the Arctic.},

	abstract = {The sensitivity of regional climate to global average radiative forcing and temperature change is important for setting global climate policy targets and designing scenarios. Setting effective policy targets requires an understanding of the consequences exceeding them, even by small amounts, and the effective design of sets of scenarios requires the knowledge of how different emissions, concentrations, or forcing need to be in order to produce substantial differences in climate outcomes. Using an extensive database of climate model simulations, we quantify how differences in global average quantities relate to differences in both the spatial extent and magnitude of climate outcomes at regional (250–1250 km) scales. We show that differences of about 0.3 °C in global average temperature are required to generate statistically significant changes in regional annual average temperature over more than half of the Earth’s land surface. A global difference of 0.8 °C is necessary to produce regional warming over half the land surface that is not only significant but reaches at least 1 °C. As much as 2.5 to 3 °C is required for a statistically significant change in regional annual average precipitation that is equally pervasive. Global average temperature change provides a better metric than radiative forcing for indicating differences in regional climate outcomes due to the path dependency of the effects of radiative forcing. For example, a difference in radiative forcing of 0.5 W m−2 can produce statistically significant differences in regional temperature over an area that ranges between 30\% and 85\% of the land surface, depending on the forcing pathway.},

	abstract = {SO2 measurements made in recent years at sites in Beijing and its surrounding areas are performed to study the variations and trends of surface SO2 at diﬀerent types of sites in Northern China. The overall average concentrations of SO2 are (16.8 ± 13.1) ppb, (14.8 ± 9.4) ppb, and (7.5 ± 4.0) ppb at China Meteorological Administration (CMA, Beijing urban area), Gucheng (GCH, relatively polluted rural area, 110 km to the southwest of Beijing urban area), and Shangdianzi (SDZ, clean background area, 100 km to the northeast of Beijing urban area), respectively. The SO2 levels in winter (heating season) are 4–6 folds higher than those in summer. There are highly signiﬁcant correlations among the daily means of SO2 at diﬀerent sites, indicating regional characteristics of SO2 pollution. Diurnal patterns of surface SO2 at all sites have a common feature with a daytime peak, which is probably caused by the downward mixing and/or the advection transport of SO2-richer air over the North China Plain. The concentrations of SO2 at CMA and GCH show highly signiﬁcant downward trends (–4.4 ppb/yr for CMA and –2.4 ppb/yr for GCH), while a less signiﬁcant trend (–0.3 ppb/yr) is identiﬁed in the data from SDZ, reﬂecting the character of SDZ as a regional atmospheric background site in North China. The SO2 concentrations of all three sites show a signiﬁcant decrease from period before to after the control measures for the 2008 Olympic Games, suggesting that the SO2 pollution control has long-term eﬀectiveness and beneﬁts. In the post-Olympics period, the mean concentrations of SO2 at CMA, GCH, and SDZ are (14.3 ± 11.0) ppb, (12.1 ± 7.7) ppb, and (7.5 ± 4.0) ppb, respectively, with reductions of 26\%, 36\%, and 13\%, respectively, compared to the levels before. Detailed analysis shows that the diﬀerences of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction were not the dominant factors for the signiﬁcant diﬀerences of SO2 between the pre-Olympics and post-Olympics periods. By extracting the data being more representative of local or regional characteristics, a reduction of up to 40\% for SO2 in polluted areas and a reduction of 20\% for regional SO2 are obtained for the eﬀect of control measures implemented for the Olympic Games.},

	abstract = {Abstract Trifluoromethane (CHF3, HFC-23) is one of the most potent greenhouse gases (GHGs), and eastern China has been recognized as a major source region, yet highly inconsistent emission estimates warrant more extensive studies. In this study, we conducted 2-year online measurements of halocarbons during 2021?2023 at an urban site in the Pearl River Delta region. The observed average HFC-23 mixing ratios of 43.6 ± 7.8 ppt were ?20\% enhanced compared to observations at the Mace Head global baseline station. Unlike other halocarbons with significant local emissions, HFC-23 mixing ratios showed distinct seasonal variations with peak values in winter and bottom values in summer. Similar seasonal patterns and highly significant correlation were observed between HFC-23 and perfluorocyclobutane (c-C4F8, PFC-318), a co-product from manufacturing PTFE using chlorodifluoromethane (CHClF2, HCFC-22) as feedstock. The weighted potential source contribution function analysis also demonstrated eastern China was the major source area for both HFC-23 and PFC-318. Tracer-based estimation revealed HFC-23 emissions of 6.7 ± 3.1 Gg yr?1 (equivalent to 98 Tg-CO2 yr?1 or 0.7\% China's annual GHG emissions in 2021) in eastern China. Our results highlight the importance of HFC-23 emission control in eastern China for China's GHG and F-gases emission reductions, and suggest that greater attention should be given to HFC-23 emissions from PTFE production, which is emerging as a more substantial source than previously anticipated.},

They use a wide range of representations of physical processes, allowing for structural (code) uncertainty to be partially quantified with multi-model ensembles (MMEs). Many models in the MMEs of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) have a common development history due to sharing of code and schemes. This makes their projections statistically dependent and introduces biases in MME statistics. Previous research has focused on model output and code dependence, and model code genealogy of CMIP models has not been fully analyzed. We present a full reconstruction of CMIP3, CMIP5, and CMIP6 code genealogy of 167 atmospheric models, GCMs, and ESMs (of which 114 participated in CMIP) based on the available literature, with a focus on the atmospheric component and atmospheric physics. We identify 12 main model families. We propose family and ancestry weighting methods designed to reduce the effect of model structural dependence in MMEs. We analyze weighted effective climate sensitivity (ECS), climate feedbacks, forcing, and global mean near-surface air temperature, and how they differ by model family. Models in the same family often have similar climate properties. We show that weighting can partially reconcile differences in ECS and cloud feedbacks between CMIP5 and CMIP6. The results can help in understanding structural dependence between CMIP models, and the proposed ancestry and family weighting methods can be used in MME assessments to ameliorate model structural sampling biases.},

	abstract = {The potentially significant role of the biogenic trace gas dimethylsulfide (DMS) in determining the Earth's radiation budget makes it necessary to accurately reproduce seawater DMS distribution and quantify its global flux across the sea/air interface. Following a threefold increase of data (from 15,000 to over 47,000) in the global surface ocean DMS database over the last decade, new global monthly climatologies of surface ocean DMS concentration and sea-to-air emission flux are presented as updates of those constructed 10 years ago. Interpolation/extrapolation techniques were applied to project the discrete concentration data onto a first guess field based on Longhurst's biogeographic provinces. Further objective analysis allowed us to obtain the final monthly maps. The new climatology projects DMS concentrations typically in the range of 1–7 nM, with higher levels occurring in the high latitudes, and with a general trend toward increasing concentration in summer. The increased size and distribution of the observations in the DMS database have produced in the new climatology substantially lower DMS concentrations in the polar latitudes and generally higher DMS concentrations in regions that were severely undersampled 10 years ago, such as the southern Indian Ocean. Using the new DMS concentration climatology in conjunction with state-of-the-art parameterizations for the sea/air gas transfer velocity and climatological wind fields, we estimate that 28.1 (17.6–34.4) Tg of sulfur are transferred from the oceans into the atmosphere annually in the form of DMS. This represents a global emission increase of 17\% with respect to the equivalent calculation using the previous climatology. This new DMS climatology represents a valuable tool for atmospheric chemistry, climate, and Earth System models.},

	abstract = {Tropospheric anthropogenic aerosols contribute the second-largest forcing to climate change, but with high uncertainty owing to their spatio-temporal variability and complicated optical properties. In this Review, we synthesize understanding of aerosol observations and their radiative and climate effects. Aerosols offset about one-third of the warming effect by anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Yet, in regions and seasons where the absorbing aerosol fraction is high — such as South America and East and South Asia — substantial atmospheric warming can occur. The internal mixing and the vertical distribution of aerosols, which alters both the direct effect and aerosol–cloud interactions, might further enhance this warming. Despite extensive research in aerosol–cloud interactions, there is still at least a 50\% spread in total aerosol forcing estimates. This ongoing uncertainty is linked, in part, to the poor measurement of anthropogenic and natural aerosol absorption, as well as the little-understood effects of aerosols on clouds. Next-generation, space-borne, multi-angle polarization and active remote sensing, combined with in situ observations, offer opportunities to better constrain aerosol scattering, absorption and size distribution, thus, improving models to refine estimates of aerosol forcing and climate effects.},

The main OH production paths from HONO, HCHO and O3 were estimated to be occupied around 57.6\%, 30.5\% and 11.9\% during daytime. The daytime OH radical concentration under steady-state was averaged at 1.02 × 107 molec cm−3, which was significantly impacted by the photolytic processes. The relationship between photolysis frequency j(O1D) and OH radical suggests that heavy fine particle loads can make the photolytic reactions less efficiently and decrease the OH production and concentration. Utilizing CO as the indicator, the part of PM2.5 mass related to primary emitted sources was found less impacted by the OH levels. The contribution of secondary organic aerosol with metrics of O3 was enhanced with the increases of the OH levels, while secondary inorganic part of PM2.5 was favor of the condition that smaller OH concentrations that 5 × 105–5 × 106 molec cm−3. Meantime, a simplified multivariate model was employed to evaluate the influences of OH levels on different parts of fine particles related to different emission and sources.

	abstract = {A new approach defined here allows for the averaging of photochemistry over complex cloud fields within a grid square and can be readily implemented in current global models. As diagnosed from observations or meteorological models, fractional cloud cover with many overlying cloud layers can generate hundreds to thousands of different cloud profiles per grid square. We define a quadrature-based method, applied here to the problem of averaging photolysis rates over this range of cloud patterns, which opens new opportunities for modeling in-cloud chemistry in global models. We select up to four representative cloud profiles, optimizing the selection and weighting of each to minimize the difference in photolysis rates when compared with the integration over the entire set of cloud distributions. To implement our algorithm, we adapt the UCI fast-JX photolysis code to the cloud statistics from the ECMWF forecast model at T42L40 resolution. For the tropics and midlatitudes, grid-square-averaged photolysis rates for O3, NO2, and NO3 using four representative atmospheres differ by at most 3.2\% RMS from rates averaged over the hundreds or more cloudy atmospheres derived from a maximum-random overlap scheme. Further, bias errors in both the free troposphere and the boundary layer are less than 1\%. Similar errors are shown to be 10–20\% for current approximation methods. Errors in the quadrature method are less than the uncertainty in the choice of maximum-random overlap schemes. We apply the method to the averaging of photochemistry over different cloud profiles and outline extensions to heterogeneous cloud chemistry.},

This development underpinned increased confidence in long-term climate changes in that report. Here, we place this development in historical context, briefly assess progress since then, and discuss the challenges and opportunities for further improving our knowledge of this iconic concept. We argue that the probability distributions published in those assessments are still approximately valid; while various subsequent studies have claimed further narrowing, they have omitted important structural uncertainties associated with missing processes, imperfect relationships, or other factors that should be included. The distributions could nonetheless be narrowed in the future, particularly through better understanding of certain climate processes and paleoclimate proxies. Not all touted strategies are truly helpful, however. We also note that ECS does not address risks from the carbon cycle or possible tipping points, and as increasingly strong mitigation (i.e., “net-zero”) scenarios are considered, ECS becomes less informative about future climate change compared to other factors such as aerosol radiative forcing and influences on regional change such as ocean dynamics.},

	abstract = {Examination of effective radiative forcing (ERF), a measure of changes in Earth's energy balance, facilitates understanding the role of various drivers of climate change. For short-lived compounds, ERF can be highly inhomogeneous geographically. The relationship between the spatial patterns of ERF and surface temperature response is poorly characterized, however. We examine that relationship in the latest generation of global climate models. We find that the uneven distribution of historical aerosol, ozone, and land use forcing leads to substantial differences compared to the well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHG). There is a stronger response per unit global mean forcing to historical inhomogeneous forcing than to WMGHG both globally and in much of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) extratropics, in fairly good agreement with results inferred from observations. Our results indicate that the enhanced global mean response is attributable to the concentration of inhomogeneous forcing in the NH extratropics, where there is strongest sensitivity to forcing, rather than to processes specific to the inhomogeneous forcers. In many regions, inclusion of inhomogeneous forcing greatly increases the spread in historical temperature changes simulated by the models, suggesting that better forcing characterization could play an important role in improving modeling of decadal-scale regional climate change. Finally, incorporating observed temperatures, the results provide estimates of global historical aerosol forcing (−1.0 ± 0.4 W m−2) consistent with other studies (though with narrower uncertainties) and also provide constraints on NH and NH extratropical historical aerosol forcing (−1.4 ± 0.6 and −1.2 ± 0.6 W m−2, respectively) and aerosol + ozone forcing.},

Our improved model, with explicit size-resolved aerosol microphysics and parametrizations of semivolatile organic oxidation products, presents a state-of-the-art performance in simulating both particle number concentrations and organic aerosol concentrations dominated (80–95\%) by SOA in the remote atmosphere, which have been challenges in previous modeling studies. The SOA formation in concert with aerosol nucleation contributes to more than 50\% of CCN concentrations in those pristine environments featuring low background aerosol concentrations. We estimate that the SOA-derived CCN alters the magnitude of cloud radiative forcing by ∼0.1 W m−2. Our findings underscore the necessity for aerosol-climate models to represent controls on CCN concentrations by SOA production.},

	abstract = {Acidity, defined as pH, is a central component of aqueous chemistry. In the atmosphere, the acidity of condensed phases (aerosol particles, cloud water, and fog droplets) governs the phase partitioning of semivolatile gases such as HNO3, NH3, HCl, and organic acids and bases as well as chemical reaction rates. It has implications for the atmospheric lifetime of pollutants, deposition, and human health. Despite its fundamental role in atmospheric processes, only recently has this field seen a growth in the number of studies on particle acidity. Even with this growth, many fine-particle pH estimates must be based on thermodynamic model calculations since no operational techniques exist for direct measurements. Current information indicates acidic fine particles are ubiquitous, but observationally constrained pH estimates are limited in spatial and temporal coverage. Clouds and fogs are also generally acidic, but to a lesser degree than particles, and have a range of pH that is quite sensitive to anthropogenic emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides, as well as ambient ammonia. Historical measurements indicate that cloud and fog droplet pH has changed in recent decades in response to controls on anthropogenic emissions, while the limited trend data for aerosol particles indicate acidity may be relatively constant due to the semivolatile nature of the key acids and bases and buffering in particles. This paper reviews and synthesizes the current state of knowledge on the acidity of atmospheric condensed phases, specifically particles and cloud droplets. It includes recommendations for estimating acidity and pH, standard nomenclature, a synthesis of current pH estimates based on observations, and new model calculations on the local and global scale.},

Here we show that almost all Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models fail to capture the observed dipole pattern of aerosol optical depth (AOD) trends over Asia during 2006–2014, last decade of CMIP6 historical simulation, due to an opposite trend over eastern China compared with observations. The incorrect AOD trend over China is attributed to problematic AA emissions adopted by CMIP6. There are obvious differences in simulated regional aerosol radiative forcing and temperature responses over Asia when using two different emissions inventories (one adopted by CMIP6; the other from Peking university, a more trustworthy inventory) to driving a global aerosol-climate model separately. We further show that some widely adopted CMIP6 pathways (after 2015) also significantly underestimate the more recent decline in AA emissions over China. These flaws may bring about errors to the CMIP6-based regional climate attribution over Asia for the last two decades and projection for the next few decades, previously anticipated to inform a wide range of impact analysis.},

	abstract = {The aerosol-climate modelling system ECHAM5-HAM is introduced. It is based on a flexible microphysical approach and, as the number of externally imposed parameters is minimised, allows the application in a wide range of climate regimes. ECHAM5-HAM predicts the evolution of an ensemble of microphysically interacting internally- and externally-mixed aerosol populations as well as their size-distribution and composition. The size-distribution is represented by a superposition of log-normal modes. In the current setup, the major global aerosol compounds sulfate (SU), black carbon (BC), particulate organic matter (POM), sea salt (SS), and mineral dust (DU) are included. The simulated global annual mean aerosol burdens (lifetimes) for the year 2000 are for SU: 0.80 Tg(S) (3.9 days), for BC: 0.11 Tg (5.4 days), for POM: 0.99 Tg (5.4 days), for SS: 10.5 Tg (0.8 days), and for DU: 8.28 Tg (4.6 days). An extensive evaluation with in-situ and remote sensing measurements underscores that the model results are generally in good agreement with observations of the global aerosol system. The simulated global annual mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) is with 0.14 in excellent agreement with an estimate derived from AERONET measurements (0.14) and a composite derived from MODIS-MISR satellite retrievals (0.16). Regionally, the deviations are not negligible. However, the main patterns of AOD attributable to anthropogenic activity are reproduced.},

Yet, the climatic impact of this evolving spatial pattern of absorbing aerosol has received relatively little attention, in particular its impact on global-mean effective radiative forcing. Here, using model experiments, we show that the effective radiative forcing from absorbing aerosol varies strongly depending on their location, driven by rapid adjustments of clouds and circulation. Our experiments generate positive effective radiative forcing in response to aerosol absorption throughout the midlatitudes and most of the tropical regions, and a strong ‘hot spot’ of negative effective radiative forcing in response to aerosol absorption over the tropical Western Pacific. Further, these diverse responses can be robustly attributed to changes in atmospheric dynamics and highlight the importance of this ‘aerosol pattern effect’ for transient forcing from regional biomass-burning aerosol.},

The aerosols’ global-mean cooling effect is fourteen times greater when emitted from the highest impact emitting region (Western Europe) than from the lowest (India). Further, radiative forcing, a widely used climate response proxy, fails as an effective predictor of global-mean cooling for national-scale aerosol emissions in our simulations; global-mean forcing-to-cooling efficacy differs fivefold depending on emitting region.

The magnitude of direct and indirect radiative forcing of aerosols since preindustrial times is a large uncertainty in climate models, which has been attributed largely to uncertainties in the preindustrial environment. Here, we report observations of the oxygen isotopic composition (Δ17O) of sulfate aerosol collected in the remote marine boundary layer (MBL) in spring and summer in order to evaluate sulfate production mechanisms in pristine-like environments. Model-aided analysis of the observations suggests that 33–50 \% of sulfate in the MBL is formed via oxidation by hypohalous acids (HOX = HOBr + HOCl), a production mechanism typically excluded in large-scale models due to uncertainties in the reaction rates, which are due mainly to uncertainties in reactive halogen concentrations. Based on the estimated fraction of sulfate formed via HOX oxidation, we further estimate that daily-averaged HOX mixing ratios on the order of 0.01–0.1 parts per trillion (ppt = pmol/mol) in the remote MBL during spring and summer are sufficient to explain the observations.},

Due to the lack of photochemically produced OH and H2O2 in high latitudes during winter, combined with high anthropogenic SO2 emissions in the Northern Hemisphere, oxidation by O3 is predicted to dominate sulfate formation during winter in this region. However, Δ17O measurements of sulfate aerosol collected in Alert, Canada, are not consistent with O3 as the dominant oxidant and indicate that a S(IV) oxidant with near-zero Δ17O values (O2) is important during winter. We use a global chemical transport model to interpret quantitatively the Alert observations and assess the global importance of sulfate production by Fe(III)- and Mn(II)-catalyzed oxidation of S(IV) by O2. We scale anthropogenic and natural atmospheric metal concentrations to primary anthropogenic sulfate and dust concentrations, respectively. The solubility and oxidation state of these metals is determined by cloud liquid water content, source, and sunlight. By including metal-catalyzed S(IV) oxidation, the model is consistent with the Δ17O magnitudes in the Alert data during winter. Globally, we find that this mechanism contributes 9–17\% to sulfate production. The inclusion of metal-catalyzed oxidation does not resolve model discrepancies with surface SO2 and sulfate observations in Europe. Oxygen isotope measurements of sulfate aerosols collected near anthropogenic and dust sources of metals would help to verify the importance of this sulfur oxidation pathway.},

	abstract = {A growing number of general circulation models are adapting interactive sulfur and aerosol schemes to improve the representation of relevant physical and chemical processes and associated feedbacks. They are motivated by investigations of climate response to major volcanic eruptions and potential solar geoengineering scenarios. However, uncertainties in these schemes are not well constrained. Stratospheric sulfate is modulated by emissions of sulfur-containing species of anthropogenic and natural origin, including volcanic activity. While the effects of volcanic eruptions have been studied in the framework of global model intercomparisons, the background conditions of the sulfur cycle have not been addressed in such a way. Here, we fill this gap by analyzing the distribution of the main sulfur species in nine global atmospheric aerosol models for a volcanically quiescent period. We use observational data to evaluate model results. Overall, models agree that the three dominant sulfur species in terms of burdens (sulfate aerosol, OCS, and SO2) make up about 98 \% stratospheric sulfur and 95 \% tropospheric sulfur. However, models vary considerably in the partitioning between these species. Models agree that anthropogenic emission of SO2 strongly affects the sulfate aerosol burden in the northern hemispheric troposphere, while its importance is very uncertain in other regions, where emissions are much lower. Sulfate aerosol is the main deposited species in all models, but the values deviate by a factor of 2. Additionally, the partitioning between wet and dry deposition fluxes is highly model dependent. Inter-model variability in the sulfur species is low in the tropics and increases towards the poles. Differences are largest in the dynamically active northern hemispheric extratropical region and could be attributed to the representation of the stratospheric circulation. The differences in the atmospheric sulfur budget among the models arise from the representation of both chemical and dynamical processes, whose interplay complicates the bias attribution. Several problematic points identified for individual models are related to the specifics of the chemistry schemes, model resolution, and representation of cross-tropopause transport in the extratropics. Further model intercomparison research is needed with a focus on the clarification of the reasons for biases, given the importance of this topic for the stratospheric aerosol injection studies.},

The importance of the different oxidation pathways of DMS and SO2 is estimated. About 23 of the sulfate is produced within clouds, with H2O2 being the most efficient pathway (59\%) and with a minor contribution due to oxidation with O3 (7\%). Predicted atmospheric surface concentrations of SO2 and sulfate and the deposition fluxes are compared with the observations. Over most parts of the globe the agreement between simulated and observed annual averages is within a factor of 2. A significant underestimate of the simulated sulfate concentrations was found in high latitudes in winter. This bias may be attributed to a too slow oxidation in clouds.

	abstract = {Aerosols could play a critical role in many processes which impact on our lives either indirectly (e.g., climate) or directly (e.g., health). However, our ability to assess these possible impacts is constrained by our limited knowledge of the physical and chemical properties of aerosols, both anthropogenic and natural. This deficiency is attributable in part to the fact that aerosols are the end product of a vast array of chemical and physical processes. Consequently, the properties of the aerosol can exhibit a great deal of variability in both time and space. Furthermore, most aerosol studies have focused on measurements of a single aerosol characteristic such as composition or size distribution. Such information is generally not useful for the assessment of impacts because the degree of impact may depend on the integral properties of the aerosol, for example, the aerosol composition as a function of particle size. In this overview we discuss recent work on atmospheric aerosols that illustrates the complex nature of the aerosol chemical and physical system, and we suggest strategies for future research. A major conclusion is that man has had a great impact on the global budgets of certain species, especially sulfur and nitrogen, that play a dominant role in the atmospheric aerosol system. These changes could conceivably affect climate. Large-scale impacts are implied because it has recently been demonstrated that natural and pollutant aerosol episodes can be propagated over great distances. However, at present there is no evidence linking anthropogenic activities with a persistent increase in aerosol concentrations on a global scale. A major problem in assessing man's impact on the atmospheric aerosol system and on global budgets is the absence of aerosol measurements in remote marine and continental areas. This dearth is especially acute for the southern hemisphere, where we could expect natural sources to predominate because of the relatively low level of industrial development and energy utilization.},

Both the direct scattering of short-wavelength solar radiation and the modification of the shortwave reflective properties of clouds by sulfate aerosol particles increase planetary albedo, thereby exerting a cooling influence on the planet. Current climate forcing due to anthropogenic sulfate is estimated to be –1 to –2 watts per square meter, globally averaged. This perturbation is comparable in magnitude to current anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing but opposite in sign. Thus, the aerosol forcing has likely offset global greenhouse warming to a substantial degree. However, differences in geographical and seasonal distributions of these forcings preclude any simple compensation. Aerosol effects must be taken into account in evaluating anthropogenic influences on past, current, and projected future climate and in formulating policy regarding controls on emission of greenhouse gases and sulfur dioxide. Resolution of such policy issues requires integrated research on the magnitude and geographical distribution of aerosol climate forcing and on the controlling chemical and physical processes.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic sulfate (SO4=) aerosol particles play two potential roles in the radiative climate of the earth. In cloud-free air, SO4= particles scatter sunlight, some of which is lost to space, thereby reducing solar irradiance at the ground. The same particles can act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), the number concentration of which is an important determinant of cloud albedo. This albedo effect, in turn, also influences incoming short-wave solar radiation. Development of a three-dimensional global model for estimating the SO4= aerosol mass concentration, along with previously-acquired information on the scattering and back-scattering coefficients per unit mass concentration allow calculation of the effects of anthropogenic SO4= aerosol on clear-sky optical depth. Subsequently, this can be used to estimate the change in hemispheric and global average reflected solar radiation. The conclusion is that the change of reflected solar flux due to anthropogenic SO4= averaged over the Northern Hemisphere is ca. - 1.1 Wm-2, which is comparable but opposite in sign to the present-day radiative forcing by anthropogenic CO2, + 1.5 Wm-2. Because of the spatial variability of the anthropogenic SO4= distribution, its meteorological effects must be studied regionally. That is, global models with regional resolution and regional data are required. Unlike the direct effect on solar irradiance, the relationship of CCN number concentration to mass concentration is not known. Thus it is not yet possible to make quantitatively reliable statements about anthropogenic forcing of cloud albedo, although there is qualitative evidence that the CCN effect may also be substantial.},

	abstract = {The effective radiative forcing of anthropogenic aerosols (ERFaer) is an important measure of the anthropogenic aerosol effects simulated by a global climate model. Here we analyze ERFaer simulated by the E3SM version 1 (E3SMv1) atmospheric model using both century-long free-running atmosphere–land simulations and short nudged simulations. We relate the simulated ERFaer to characteristics of the aerosol composition and optical properties, and we evaluate the relationships between key aerosol and cloud properties.

 In terms of historical changes from the year 1870 to 2014, our results show that the global mean anthropogenic aerosol burden and optical depth increase during the simulation period as expected, but the regional averages show large differences in the temporal evolution. The largest regional differences are found in the emission-induced evolution of the burden and optical depth of the sulfate aerosol: a strong decreasing trend is seen in the Northern Hemisphere high-latitude region after around 1970, while a continued increase is simulated in the tropics. The relationships between key aerosol and cloud properties (relative changes between pre-industrial and present-day conditions) also show evident changes after 1970, diverging from the linear relationships exhibited for the period of 1870–1969. In addition to the regional differences in the simulated relationships, a reduced sensitivity in cloud droplet number and other cloud properties to aerosol perturbations is seen when the aerosol perturbation is large. Consequently, the global annual mean ERFaer magnitude does not increase after around 1970.

 The ERFaer in E3SMv1 is relatively large compared to the recently published multi-model estimates; the primary reason is the large indirect aerosol effect (i.e., through aerosol–cloud interactions). Compared to other models, E3SMv1 features large relative changes in the cloud droplet effective radius in response to aerosol perturbations. Large sensitivity is also seen in the liquid cloud optical depth, which is determined by changes in both the effective radius and liquid water path. Aerosol-induced changes in liquid and ice cloud properties in E3SMv1 are found to have a strong correlation, as the evolution of anthropogenic sulfate aerosols affects both the liquid cloud formation and the homogeneous ice nucleation in cirrus clouds (that causes a large effect on longwave ERFaer).

 As suggested by a previous study, the large ERFaer appears to be one of the reasons why the model cannot reproduce the observed global mean temperature evolution in the second half of the 20th century. Sensitivity simulations are performed to understand which parameterization and/or parameter changes have a large impact on the simulated ERFaer. The ERFaer estimates in E3SMv1 for the shortwave and longwave components are sensitive to the parameterization changes in both liquid and ice cloud processes. When the parameterization of ice cloud processes is modified, the top-of-model forcing changes in the shortwave and longwave components largely offset each other, so the net effect is negligible. This suggests that, to reduce the magnitude of the net ERFaer, it would be more effective to reduce the anthropogenic aerosol effect through liquid or mixed-phase clouds.},

Reproduction of historical atmospheric pollution levels based on global aerosol models and emission changes is crucial to prove that such models are able to predict future scenarios. Here, we analyze consistency of trends in observations of sulfur components in air and precipitation from major regional networks and estimates from six different global aerosol models from 1990 until 2015. There are large interregional differences in the sulfur trends consistently captured by the models and observations, especially for North America and Europe. Europe had the largest reductions in sulfur emissions in the first part of the period while the highest reduction came later in North America and East Asia. The uncertainties in both the emissions and the representativity of the observations are larger in Asia. However, emissions from East Asia clearly increased from 2000 to 2005 followed by a decrease, while in India a steady increase over the whole period has been observed and modelled. The agreement between a bottom-up approach, which uses emissions and process-based chemical transport models, with independent observations gives an improved confidence in the understanding of the atmospheric sulfur budget.},

	abstract = {Tropospheric ozone is an important component of the Earth system as it can affect both climate and air quality. In this work, we use observed tropospheric column ozone derived from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) OMI-MLS, in addition to OMI ozone retrieved in discrete vertical layers, and compare it to tropospheric ozone from UM-UKCA simulations (which utilize the Unified Model, UM, coupled to UK Chemistry and Aerosol, UKCA). Our aim is to investigate recent changes (2005–2018) in tropospheric ozone in the North Atlantic region, specifically its seasonal, interannual and decadal variability, and to understand what factors are driving such changes. The model exhibits a large positive bias (greater than 5 DU or ∼ 50 \%) in the tropical upper troposphere: through sensitivity experiments, time series correlation, and comparison with the Lightning Imaging Sensor and Optical Transient Detector lightning flash dataset, the model positive bias in the tropics is attributed to shortcomings in the convection and lightning parameterizations, which overestimate lightning flashes in the tropics relative to mid-latitudes. Use of OMI data, for which vertical averaging kernels and a priori information are available, suggests that the model negative bias (6–10 DU or ∼ 20 \%) at mid-latitudes, relative to OMI-MLS tropospheric column, could be the result of vertical sampling. Ozone in the North Atlantic peaks in spring and early summer, with generally good agreement between the modelled and observed seasonal cycle. Recent trends in tropospheric ozone were investigated: whilst both observational datasets indicate positive trends of ∼ 5 \% and ∼ 10 \% in North Atlantic ozone, the modelled ozone trends are much closer to zero and have large uncertainties. North Atlantic ozone interannual variability (IAV) in the model was found to be correlated to the IAV of ozone transported to the North Atlantic from the stratosphere (R=0.77) and emission of NOx from lightning in the tropics (R=0.72). The discrepancy between modelled and observed trends for 2005–2018 could be linked to the model underestimating lower stratospheric ozone trends and associated stratosphere to troposphere transport. Modelled tropospheric ozone IAV is driven by IAV of tropical emissions of NOx from lightning and IAV of ozone transport from the stratosphere; however, the modelled and observed IAV differ. To understand the IAV discrepancy we investigated how modelled ozone and its drivers respond to large-scale modes of variability. Using OMI height-resolved data and model idealized tracers, we were able to identify stratospheric transport of ozone into the troposphere as the main driver of the dynamical response of North Atlantic ozone to the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Finally, we found that the modelled ozone IAV is too strongly correlated to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) compared to observed ozone IAV. This is again linked to shortcomings in the lightning flashes parameterization, which underestimates (overestimates) lightning flash production in the tropics during positive (negative) ENSO events.},

The feasibility of using SO2 as a tracer for the ash released during the eruption is investigated here through comparison of ash retrievals from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) with SO2 measurements from a number of infrared and ultraviolet satellite-based sensors. Results demonstrate that the eruption can be divided into an initial ashrich phase, a lower intensity middle phase and a ﬁnal phase where considerably greater quantities both ash and SO2 were released. Comparisons of ash-SO2 dispersion indicate that despite frequent collocation of the two species, there are a number of instances throughout the eruption where separation is observed. This separation occurs vertically due to the more rapid settling rate of ash compared to SO2, horizontally through wind shear and temporally through volcanological controls on eruption style. The potential for the two species to be dispersed independently has consequences in terms of aircraft hazard mitigation and highlights the importance of monitoring both species concurrently.},

	abstract = {The 2014–2015 Bárðarbunga-Veiðivötn ﬁssure eruption at Holuhraun produced about 1.5 km3 of lava, making it the largest eruption in Iceland in more than 200 years. Over the course of the eruption, daily volcanic sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions exceeded daily SO2 emissions from all anthropogenic sources in Europe in 2010 by at least a factor of 3. We present surface air quality observations from across Northern Europe together with satellite remote sensing data and model simulations of volcanic SO2 for September 2014. We show that volcanic SO2 was transported in the lowermost troposphere over long distances and detected by air quality monitoring stations up to 2750 km away from the source. Using retrievals from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), we calculate an average daily SO2 mass burden of 99 ± 49 kilotons (kt) of SO2 from OMI and 61 ± 18 kt of SO2 from IASI for September 2014. This volcanic burden is at least a factor of 2 greater than the average SO2 mass burden between 2007 and 2009 due to anthropogenic emissions from the whole of Europe. Combining the observational data with model simulations using the United Kingdom Met Ofﬁce’s Numerical Atmospheric-dispersion Modelling Environment model, we are able to constrain SO2 emission rates to up to 120 kilotons per day (kt/d) during early September 2014, followed by a decrease to 20–60 kt/d between 6 and 22 September 2014, followed by a renewed increase to 60–120 kt/d until the end of September 2014. Based on these ﬂuxes, we estimate that the eruption emitted a total of 2.0 ± 0.6 Tg of SO2 during September 2014, in good agreement with ground-based remote sensing and petrological estimates. Although satellite-derived and model-simulated vertical column densities of SO2 agree well, the model simulations are biased low by up to a factor of 8 when compared to surface observations of volcanic SO2 on 6–7 September 2014 in Ireland. These biases are mainly due to relatively small horizontal and vertical positional errors in the simulations of the volcanic plume occurring over transport distances of thousands of kilometers. Although the volcanic air pollution episodes were transient and lava-dominated volcanic eruptions are sporadic events, the observations suggest that (i) during an eruption, volcanic SO2 measurements should be assimilated for near real-time air quality forecasting and (ii) existing air quality monitoring networks should be retained or extended to monitor SO2 and other volcanic pollutants.},

	abstract = {Using volcanic sulfur dioxide emissions in an aerosol-climate model, we derive a time series of global-mean volcanic effective radiative forcing (ERF) from 1979 to 2015. For 2005–2015, we calculate a global multiannual mean volcanic ERF of À0.08 W/m2 relative to the volcanically quiescent 1999–2002 period, due to a high frequency of small-to-moderate-magnitude explosive eruptions after 2004. For eruptions of large magnitude such as 1991 Mt. Pinatubo, our model-simulated volcanic ERF, which accounts for rapid adjustments including aerosol perturbations of clouds, is less negative than that reported in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) that only accounted for stratospheric temperature adjustments. We ﬁnd that, when rapid adjustments are considered, the relation between volcanic forcing and volcanic stratospheric optical depth (SAOD) is 13–21\% weaker than reported in IPCC AR5 for large-magnitude eruptions. Further, our analysis of the recurrence frequency of eruptions reveals that sulfur-rich small-to-moderate-magnitude eruptions with column heights ≥10 km occur frequently, with periods of volcanic quiescence being statistically rare. Small-to-moderate-magnitude eruptions should therefore be included in climate model simulations, given the {\textgreater}50\% chance of one or two eruptions to occur in any given year. Not all of these eruptions affect the stratospheric aerosol budget, but those that do increase the nonvolcanic background SAOD by {\textasciitilde}0.004 on average, contributing {\textasciitilde}50\% to the total SAOD in the absence of large-magnitude eruptions. This equates to a volcanic ERF of about À0.10 W/m2, which is about two thirds of the ERF from ozone changes induced by ozone-depleting substances.},

	abstract = {Volcanic eruptions take place in Iceland about once every 3 to 5 years. Ash emissions from these eruptions can cause signiﬁcant disruption to air trafﬁc over Europe and the North Atlantic as is evident from the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is also emitted by volcanoes, but there are no criteria to deﬁne when airspace is considered hazardous or nonhazardous. However, SO2 is a well-known ground-level pollutant that can have detrimental effects on human health. We have used the United Kingdom Met Ofﬁce’s NAME (Numerical Atmospheric-dispersion Modelling Environment) model to simulate SO2 mass concentrations that could occur in European and North Atlantic airspace for a range of hypothetical explosive eruptions in Iceland with a probability to occur about once every 3 to 5 years. Model performance was evaluated for the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull summit eruption against SO2 vertical column density retrievals from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument and in situ measurements from the United Kingdom Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements research aircraft. We show that at no time during the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption did SO2 mass concentrations at ﬂight altitudes violate European air quality standards. In contrast, during a hypothetical short-duration explosive eruption similar to Hekla in 2000 (emitting 0.2 Tg of SO2 within 2 h, or an average SO2 release rate 250 times that of Eyjafjallajökull 2010), simulated SO2 concentrations are greater than 1063 μg/m3 for about 48 h in a small area of European and North Atlantic airspace. By calculating the occurrence of aircraft encounters with the volcanic plume of a short-duration eruption, we show that a 15 min or longer exposure of aircraft and passengers to concentrations ≥500 μg/m3 has a probability of about 0.1\%. Although exposure of humans to such concentrations may lead to irritations to the eyes, nose and, throat and cause increased airway resistance even in healthy individuals, the risk is very low. However, the fact that volcanic ash and sulfur species are not always collocated and that passenger comfort could be compromised might be incentives to provide real-time information on the presence or absence of volcanic SO2. Such information could aid aviation risk management during and after volcanic eruptions.},

	abstract = {A technique has been developed that uses Puff, a volcanic ash transport and dispersion (VATD) model, to forecast the relative exposure of aircraft and ground facilities to ash from a volcanic eruption. VATD models couple numerical weather prediction (NWP) data with physical descriptions of the initial eruptive plume, atmospheric dispersion, and settling of ash particles. Three distinct examples of variations on the technique are given using ERA-40 archived reanalysis NWP data. The Feb. 2000 NASA DC-8 event involving an eruption of Hekla volcano, Iceland is first used for analyzing a single flight. Results corroborate previous analyses that conclude the aircraft did encounter a diffuse cloud of volcanic origin, and indicate exposure within a factor of 10 compared to measurements made on the flight. The sensitivity of the technique to dispersion physics is demonstrated. The Feb. 2001 eruption of Mt. Cleveland, Alaska is used as a second example to demonstrate how this technique can be utilized to quickly assess the potential exposure of a multitude of aircraft during and soon after an event. Using flight tracking data from over 40,000 routes over three days, several flights that may have encountered low concentrations of ash were identified, and the exposure calculated. Relative changes in the quantity of exposure when the eruption duration is varied are discussed, and no clear trend is evident as the exposure increased for some flights and decreased for others. A third application of this technique is demonstrated by forecasting the nearsurface airborne concentrations of ash that the cities of Yakima Washington, Boise Idaho, and Kelowna British Columbia might have experienced from an eruption of Mt. St. Helens anytime during the year 2000. Results indicate that proximity to the source does not accurately determine the potential hazard. Although an eruption did not occur during this time, the results serve as a demonstration of how existing cities or potential locations of research facilities or military bases can be assessed for susceptibility to hazardous and unhealthy concentrations of ash and other volcanic gases.},

	abstract = {Satellite measurements of volcanic sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions can provide critical information for aviation hazard mitigation, particularly when ash detection techniques fail. Recent developments in space-based SO2 monitoring are discussed, focusing on daily, global ultraviolet (UV) measurements by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASA’s Aura satellite. OMI’s high sensitivity to SO2 permits long-range tracking of volcanic clouds in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) and accurate mapping of their perimeters to facilitate avoidance. Examples from 2006 to 2007 include eruptions of Soufriere Hills (Montserrat), Rabaul (Papua New Guinea), Nyamuragira (DR Congo), and Jebel at Tair (Yemen). A tendency for some volcanic clouds to occupy the jet stream suggests an increased threat to aircraft that exploit this phenomenon. Synergy between NASA A-Train sensors such as OMI and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on the Aqua satellite can provide critical information on volcanic cloud altitude. OMI and AIRS SO2 data products are being produced in near real-time for distribution to Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAACs) via a NOAA website. Operational issues arising from these improved SO2 measurements include the reliability of SO2 as proxy for co-erupted ash, the duration of VAAC advisories for long-lived volcanic clouds, and the potential effects of elevated concentrations of SO2 and sulfate aerosol in ash-poor clouds on aircraft and avionics (including cumulative effects after multiple inadvertent transits through dilute clouds). Further research is required in these areas. Aviation community assistance is sought through continued reporting of sulfurous odors or other indications of diffuse volcanic cloud encounters, in order to validate the satellite retrievals.},

	abstract = {Internal cooling passages of turbine blades have long been at risk to blockage through the deposition of sand and dust during fleet service life. The ingestion of high volumes of volcanic ash (VA) therefore poses a real risk to engine operability. An additional difficulty is that the cooling system is frequently impossible to inspect in order to assess the level of deposition. This paper reports results from experiments carried out at typical high pressure (HP) turbine blade metal temperatures (1163 K to 1293 K) and coolant inlet temperatures (800 K to 900 K) in engine scale models of a turbine cooling passage with film-cooling offtakes. Volcanic ash samples from the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption were used for the majority of the experiments conducted. A further ash sample from the Chaiten eruption allowed the effect of changing ash chemical composition to be investigated. The experimental rig allows the metered delivery of volcanic ash through the coolant system at the start of a test. The key metric indicating blockage is the flow parameter (FP), which can be determined over a range of pressure ratios (1.01–1.06) before and after each experiment, with visual inspection used to determine the deposition location. Results from the experiments have determined the threshold metal temperature at which blockage occurs for the ash samples available, and characterize the reduction of flow parameter with changing particle size distribution, blade metal temperature, ash sample composition, film-cooling hole configuration and pressure ratio across the holes. There is qualitative evidence that hole geometry can be manipulated to decrease the likelihood of blockage. A discrete phase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model implemented in Fluent has allowed the trajectory of the ash particles within the coolant passages to be modeled, and these results are used to help explain the behavior observed.},

	abstract = {As part of the cross industry efforts to get aircraft flying again during the April/May 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajokull RollsRoyce produced a chart that plotted examples of aircraft engine exposure to volcanic ash against the ash concentration the engines had been exposed to. This chart became known as the Rolls-Royce ‘Safe-to-Fly’ chart, and it was used to guide decisions on how the UK Met Office ash concentration charts for the Eyjafjallajokull eruption could be utilised to help aviators plan their flight paths. Over the period 2011–2013, this paper’s authors reassessed the engine data that made up the ‘Safe-to-Fly’ chart, and in particular the data relating to two key exposure events at high ash concentrations, flight BA009 on 24 June 1982 and flight KLM867 on 15 December 1989. Through a combination of reassessment of the original engineering calculations carried out for these events (i.e. calculations based on evidence from engine hardware) and assessments of relevant volcanological and ash cloud visibility data, it has been concluded that these events are unlikely to have occurred at or near the 2000 mg/m3 ash concentration arrived at in 2010; based on current evidence, it is more plausible that these events occurred in ash concentrations of around 200 mg/m3. As a consequence, a revision to the ‘Safe-to-Fly’ chart is recommended. In addition, to more easily present the main considerations associated with flight within ash concentrations where the ash would start to become visible, a new chart is proposed that plots duration of exposure against ash concentration. The points plotted on this chart are the revised understanding of the BA009 and KLM867 events, other relevant engine exposure events and speculative regions where flight would be unsafe and where flight would be safe, but engines would be susceptible to long-term damage.},

However, the rate of oxidation of sulfur dioxide (SO2) precursor gas to sulfate aerosols (SO42-) in volcanic plumes is poorly known, especially in the troposphere. Here we determine the chemical speciation as well as the intensity and temporal persistence of the impact on air quality of sulfate aerosols from the 2014–2015 Holuhraun flood lava eruption of Icelandic volcano Bárðarbunga. To do so, we jointly analyse a set of SO2 observations from satellite (OMPS and IASI) and ground-level measurements from air quality monitoring stations together with high temporal resolution mass spectrometry measurements of an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) performed far from the volcanic source. We explore month/year long ACSM data in France from stations in contrasting environments, close and far from industrial sulfur-rich activities. We demonstrate that volcanic sulfate aerosols exhibit a distinct chemical signature in urban/rural conditions, with NO3:SO4 mass concentration ratios lower than for non-volcanic background aerosols. These results are supported by thermodynamic simulations of aerosol composition, using the ISORROPIA II model, which show that ammonium sulfate aerosols are preferentially formed at a high concentration of sulfate, leading to a decrease in the production of particulate ammonium nitrate. Such a chemical signature is however more difficult to identify at heavily polluted industrial sites due to a high level of background noise in sulfur. Nevertheless, aged volcanic sulfates can be distinguished from freshly emitted industrial sulfates according to their contrasting degree of anion neutralization. Combining AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) sunphotometric data with ACSM observations, we also show a long persistence over weeks of pollution in volcanic sulfate aerosols, while SO2 pollution disappears in a few days at most. Finally, gathering 6-month long datasets from 27 sulfur monitoring stations of the EMEP (European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme) network allows us to demonstrate a much broader large-scale European pollution, in both SO2 and SO4, associated with the Holuhraun eruption, from Scandinavia to France. While widespread SO2 anomalies, with ground-level mass concentrations far exceeding background values, almost entirely result from the volcanic source, the origin of sulfate aerosols is more complex. Using a multi-site concentration-weighted trajectory analysis, emissions from the Holuhraun eruption are shown to be one of the main sources of SO4 at all EMEP sites across Europe and can be distinguished from anthropogenic emissions from eastern Europe but also from Great Britain. A wide variability in SO2:SO4 mass concentration ratios, ranging from 0.8 to 8.0, is shown at several stations geographically dispersed at thousands of kilometres from the eruption site. Despite this apparent spatial complexity, we demonstrate that these mass oxidation ratios can be explained by a simple linear dependency on the age of the plume, with a SO2-to-SO4 oxidation rate of 0.23 h−1. Most current studies generally focus on SO2, an unambiguous and more readily measured marker of the volcanic plume. However, the long persistence of the chemical fingerprint of volcanic sulfate aerosols at continental scale, as shown for the Holuhraun eruption here, casts light on the impact of tropospheric eruptions and passive degassing activities on air quality, health, atmospheric chemistry and climate.},

Previous studies that have examined the impact of the Laki eruption on sulfate aerosol and climate have either used an aerosol model coupled off‐line to a general circulation model (GCM) or used a GCM with incomplete aerosol microphysics. Here, we study the impact on stratospheric aerosol evolution and stratospheric and tropospheric circulation using a fully coupled GCM with complete aerosol microphysics, the Community Earth System Model version 1, with the Whole Atmosphere Chemistry Climate Model high‐top atmosphere component. Simulations indicate that the Laki aerosols had peak average effective radii of approximately 0.4 μm in Northern Hemisphere (NH) middle and high latitudes, with peak average effective radii of 0.25 μm in NH tropics and 0.2 μm in the Southern Hemisphere. We ﬁnd that the Laki aerosols are transported globally and have signiﬁcant impacts on the circulation in both hemispheres, strengthening the Southern Hemisphere polar vortex and shifting the tropospheric NH subtropical jet equatorward.},

While the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption was the last large explosive eruption, recent studies have shed light on the impacts of moderate‐sized eruptions since the year 2000 on the global stratospheric aerosol budget. We use an ensemble of simulations from a coupled climate‐chemistry model to quantify and analyze changes in NO and NO2 (NOx), N2O5, HNO3, ClO, and ClONO2 during periods of increased stratospheric volcanic aerosol concentrations since 2000. By using an ensemble approach, we are able to distinguish forced responses from internal variability. We also compare the model ensemble results to satellite measurements of these changes in atmospheric composition, including measurements from the Optical Spectrograph and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer on the Odin satellite and the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder. We ﬁnd decreases in stratospheric NOx concentrations up to 20 hPa, consistent with increases in stratospheric HNO3 concentrations. The HNO3 perturbations also extend higher, up to 5 hPa, associated with periods of increased volcanic aerosol concentrations in both model simulations and observations, though correlations with volcanic aerosol are considerably higher in the model simulations. The model simulates increases in ClO at altitudes and magnitudes similar to the NOx reductions, but this response is below the detectable limit in the available observations (100 pptv). We also demonstrate the value of accounting for transport‐related anomalies of atmospheric trace gases by regression onto N2O anomalies.},

	abstract = {Abstract. We perform the first multi-model intercomparison of the impact of nudged
meteorology on the stratospheric residual circulation using hindcast
simulations from the Chemistry–Climate Model Initiative (CCMI). We examine
simulations over the period 1980–2009 from seven models in which the
meteorological fields are nudged towards a reanalysis dataset and compare
these with their equivalent free-running simulations and the reanalyses
themselves. We show that for the current implementations, nudging
meteorology does not constrain the mean strength of the stratospheric
residual circulation and that the inter-model spread is similar, or even larger,
than in the free-running simulations. The nudged models generally show
slightly stronger upwelling in the tropical lower stratosphere compared to
the free-running versions and exhibit marked differences compared to the
directly estimated residual circulation from the reanalysis dataset they are
nudged towards. Downward control calculations applied to the nudged
simulations reveal substantial differences between the climatological lower-stratospheric tropical upward mass flux (TUMF) computed from the modelled
wave forcing and that calculated directly from the residual circulation.
This explicitly shows that nudging decouples the wave forcing and the
residual circulation so that the divergence of the angular momentum flux
due to the mean motion is not balanced by eddy motions, as would typically
be expected in the time mean. Overall, nudging meteorological fields leads
to increased inter-model spread for most of the measures of the mean
climatological stratospheric residual circulation assessed in this study. In
contrast, the nudged simulations show a high degree of consistency in the
inter-annual variability in the TUMF in the lower stratosphere, which is
primarily related to the contribution to variability from the resolved wave
forcing. The more consistent inter-annual variability in TUMF in the nudged
models also compares more closely with the variability found in the
reanalyses, particularly in boreal winter. We apply a multiple linear
regression (MLR) model to separate the drivers of inter-annual and long-term
variations in the simulated TUMF; this explains up to ∼75 \%
of the variance in TUMF in the nudged simulations. The MLR model reveals a
statistically significant positive trend in TUMF for most models over the
period 1980–2009. The TUMF trend magnitude is generally larger in the nudged
models compared to their free-running counterparts, but the intermodel range
of trends doubles from around a factor of 2 to a factor of 4 due to nudging.
Furthermore, the nudged models generally do not match the TUMF trends in the
reanalysis they are nudged towards for trends over different periods in the
interval 1980–2009. Hence, we conclude that nudging does not strongly
constrain long-term trends simulated by the chemistry–climate model (CCM) in the
residual circulation. Our findings show that while nudged simulations may,
by construction, produce accurate temperatures and realistic representations
of fast horizontal transport, this is not typically the case for the slower
zonal mean vertical transport in the stratosphere. Consequently, caution is
required when using nudged simulations to interpret the behaviour of
stratospheric tracers that are affected by the residual circulation.},

Our results shed new light on differences between the predictions of 1-D and 3-D plume models. Furthermore, both models suggest that as a result of ongoing climate change, for tropical eruptions, (i) higher eruption intensities will be required for plumes to reach the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere and (ii) the height of plumes currently reaching the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere or above will increase. We discuss the implications of these results for the climatic impacts of future eruptions. Our simulations can directly inform climate model experiments on climate-volcano feedback.},

These effects were due to the direct impact of volcanic ash on jet aircraft, as well as to the rerouting and cancellations of flight operations owing to eruptive activity. Between December and February, five commercial jetliners were damaged from ash encounters. The most serious incident took place on December 15, 1989 when a Boeing 747-400 aircraft temporarily lost power of all four engines after encountering an ash cloud as the airplane descended for a landing in Anchorage. While there were no injuries to passengers, the damage to engines, avionics, and aircraft structure from this encounter is estimated at \$80 million. Four additional encounters between jet aircraft and Redoubt ash clouds occurred in the Anchorage area on December 15 and 16, 1989 and February 21, 1990; none resulted in engine failure. Two additional encounters took place on December 17, 1989 when jet airliners encountered the Redoubt cloud over west Texas. At the time of these encounters, the cloud was up to 55 hours old and had traveled in excess of 2,900 nautical miles ( 5,300 km).},

	abstract = {Interest in stratospheric aerosol and its role in climate have increased over the last decade due to the observed increase in stratospheric aerosol since 2000 and the potential for changes in the sulfur cycle induced by climate change. This review provides an overview about the advances in stratospheric aerosol research since the last comprehensive assessment of stratospheric aerosol was published in 2006. A crucial development since 2006 is the substantial improvement in the agreement between in situ and space-based inferences of stratospheric aerosol properties during volcanically quiescent periods. Furthermore, new measurement systems and techniques, both in situ and space based, have been developed for measuring physical aerosol properties with greater accuracy and for characterizing aerosol composition. However, these changes induce challenges to constructing a long-term stratospheric aerosol climatology. Currently, changes in stratospheric aerosol levels less than 20\% cannot be conﬁdently quantiﬁed. The volcanic signals tend to mask any nonvolcanically driven change, making them difﬁcult to understand. While the role of carbonyl sulﬁde as a substantial and relatively constant source of stratospheric sulfur has been conﬁrmed by new observations and model simulations, large uncertainties remain with respect to the contribution from anthropogenic sulfur dioxide emissions. New evidence has been provided that stratospheric aerosol can also contain small amounts of nonsulfate matter such as black carbon and organics. Chemistry-climate models have substantially increased in quantity and sophistication. In many models the implementation of stratospheric aerosol processes is coupled to radiation and/or stratospheric chemistry modules to account for relevant feedback processes.},

Here we demonstrate for the first time that large improvements can be made in quantitative predictions of the fate of volcanic ash emissions, by using an inversion scheme that couples a priori source information and the output of a Lagrangian dispersion model with satellite data to estimate the volcanic ash source strength as a function of altitude and time. From the inversion, we obtain a total fine ash emission of the eruption of 8.3 ± 4.2 Tg for particles in the size range of 2.8–28 μm diameter. We evaluate the results of our model results with a posteriori ash emissions using independent ground-based, airborne and space-borne measurements both in case studies and statistically. Subsequently, we estimate the area over Europe affected by volcanic ash above certain concentration thresholds relevant for the aviation industry. We find that during three episodes in April and May, volcanic ash concentrations at some altitude in the atmosphere exceeded the limits for the "Normal" flying zone in up to 14 \% (6–16 \%), 2 \% (1–3 \%) and 7 \% (4–11 \%), respectively, of the European area. For a limit of 2 mg m−3 only two episodes with fractions of 1.5 \% (0.2–2.8 \%) and 0.9 \% (0.1–1.6 \%) occurred, while the current "No-Fly" zone criterion of 4 mg m−3 was rarely exceeded. Our results have important ramifications for determining air space closures and for real-time quantitative estimations of ash concentrations. Furthermore, the general nature of our method yields better constraints on the distribution and fate of volcanic ash in the Earth system.},

	abstract = {We compiled a global data set of volcanic degassing during both explosive and quiescent volcanic events. The data set comprises estimates of gas emissions of volcanoes from Europe (e.g. Etna), Asia (e.g. Merapi), the Americas (e.g. Fuego), Africa (e.g. Erta Ale) and ocean islands (e.g. Kilauea) over the past 100 yr. The set includes 50 monitored volcanoes and V310 extrapolated explosively erupting volcanoes. Among the V360 volcanoes, 75\% are located in the Northern and 25\% in the Southern Hemisphere. We have estimated the total annual global volcanic sulfur emission into the atmosphere to be on the order of 7.5{\textasciicircum}10.5U1012 g/yr S (here as SO2), amounting to 10{\textasciicircum}15\% of the annual anthropogenic sulfur output (V70U1012 g/yr S during the decade 1981{\textasciicircum}1990) and 7.5{\textasciicircum}10.5\% of the total global sulfur emission (e.g. biomass burning, anthropogenic, dimethylsulfide) with V100U1012 g/yr S. The estimates of other volcanic gases emitted (e.g. H2S, HCl) are based on the assumption that the different gas components emitted by a volcano are in equilibrium with each other. Accordingly, the molar ratios of the gas species in high-temperature fumaroles are similar to molar ratios equilibrated at depth where the gas separates from the magma. Thus, we can use the directly measured SO2 fluxes and known molar ratios (e.g. H2S/SO2) for a semiquantitative estimate of other gas components emitted (e.g. H2S). The total annual emission of HCl is 1.2{\textasciicircum}170U1012 g/yr, that of H2S 1.5{\textasciicircum}37.1U1012 g/yr, of HF 0.7{\textasciicircum}8.6U1012 g/yr, of HBr 2.6{\textasciicircum}43.2U109 g/yr, and of OCS 9.4U107{\textasciicircum} 3.2U1011 g/yr. We estimate an emission of 1.3U107{\textasciicircum}4.4U1010 g/yr for CS2. ß 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Surface ozone concentrations show a strong seasonality, with maximum in the dry months of December to April and minimum during the wet southwest (SW) monsoon period extending from May to October. High ozone concentrations are related to biomass burning in the northeast highland regions of the country and neighboring Myanmar and southern China. These precursors travel in a southerly direction towards Bangkok in a well-deﬁned aerosol layer which may be at ground level or at elevated heights. The growth of the daytime mixed layer scavenges some of the upper level aerosols, although local maxima in ozone concentrations at 1–2 km are a frequent feature at Bangkok. There is an evidence of fumigation in the Gulf of Thailand and a return ﬂow via the southerly sea breezes.},

This study investigated the significance of elevated air pollution layers over the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) from all available aerosol layer scenes taken from Cloud–Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) for years 2007 to 2011. The results show that biomass burning smoke layers alone were the most frequently observed. The smoke layers accounted for high AOD variations and increased AOD levels. In the dry seasons, the smoke layers alone with high AOD levels were likely brought to the BMR via northeasterly to easterly prevailing winds and found at altitudes above the typical BMR mixing heights of approximately 0.7 to 1.5 km. The smoke should be attributed to biomass burning emissions outside the BMR.},

To ﬁnd the major contributing sources of PM2.5, the PM composition data were analyzed by a receptor modeling approach while the pollution load from BMR sources to the air was characterized by an emission inventory. Our data show generally alarming levels of PM2.5 in the region, of which transportation and biomass burning are two major sources. In this paper, we present a general overview of our observational ﬁndings, contrast the scientiﬁc information with the policy context of air quality management in BMR, and discuss policy implications. In BMR, where a set of conventional regulatory instruments on air quality management are already in place, a solution for the air pollution problem should lie in a combination of air quality regulation and other policies, such as energy and agricultural policies.},

This study comparatively investigated levels of ﬁne particles (PM2.5), SO2, NO2, and BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes) at ﬁxed roadsides and on traveling routes in congested urban and less congested suburban areas of Bangkok in 2010. The roadside air quality monitoring was done at two opposite sites across the selected roads. The trafﬁc counting was made simultaneously in these roads and hourly ﬂows of 8 different vehicle types were determined. Roadside PM2.5 levels during dry season were high in both the city center and suburban area, signiﬁcantly above the wet season, with 65e75\% measurements exceeded 24 h Thailand ambient air quality standard of 50 mg mÀ3. Oppositely, roadside BTEX levels measured in the city center during wet season were higher than dry season and well above those in suburban area. Diurnal variations and the results of SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) analysis showed associations between roadside pollutants levels and hourly trafﬁc ﬂows. The differences in pollution levels between 2 monitoring sites across a road were explained by road conﬁgurations and prevalent wind directions. On-route pollution levels were measured simultaneously both inside and outside selected vehicles (van, pickup), and on motorcycle. The on-route PM2.5 levels along the urban route were higher during the dry season than wet season. PM2.5 levels inside the vehicles were lower than outside whereas the opposite was observed for BTEX. BTEX were higher on more congested urban sub-routes with lower vehicle speeds. Higher pollution levels suggest a high risk of exposure.},

To date, considerable progress has been made toward understanding the PM2.5 problem, including spatial-temporal characterization, driving factors, and health effects. However, little research has been done on the dynamic interactions and relationships between PM2.5 concentrations in different cities in this area. To address the research gap, this study discovered a phenomenon of time-lagged intercity correlations of PM2.5 time series and proposed a visualization framework based on this phenomenon to visualize the interaction in PM2.5 concentrations between cities. The visualizations produced using the framework show that there are significant time-lagged correlations between the PM2.5 time series in different cities in this area. The visualizations also show that the correlations are more significant in colder months and between cities that are closer, and that there are seasonal changes in the temporal order of the correlated PM2.5 time series. Further analysis suggests that the timelagged intercity correlations of PM2.5 time series are most likely due to synoptic meteorological variations. We argue that the visualizations demonstrate the interactions of air pollution between cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area and the significant effect of synoptic meteorological conditions on PM2.5 pollution. The visualization framework could help determine the pathway of regional transportation of air pollution and may also be useful in delineating the area of interaction of PM2.5 pollution for impact analysis.},

In the past decades, Bangkok has experienced extraordinary economic development and urban expansion, all the while displaying notable concern regarding the ambient air pollution and its adverse effects on human health. In this study, 16-years of air quality monitoring data were collected from 25 stations in BMR, which are operated by the Thailand’s Pollution Control Department. Data for O3, PM10, NOx, CO and SO2 were analyzed temporally with a particular focus on long-term, seasonal and diurnal variations. The data were also analyzed spatially to identify the hotspots and flow of air pollution in the region. These investigations were performed to assess the evolution of air quality in BMR over the past 16 years and identify areas of potential concern. Analysis of the data indicated that PM10, NOx , CO and SO2 were in a moderate decline over the 16 years, while O3 concentration has risen steadily throughout this time period. The results and findings of these investigations are discussed with a perspective to provide policy recommendations for air quality improvements in BMR.},

The presented data shows that monitoring number and/or surface area concentrations besides the mass concentration provides valuable information for a meaningful assessment of the actual ambient air quality. The aim of the study was to characterize the urban aerosols using various instruments, methods, and sampling conditions, and to determine whether a split of the PM2.5 size fraction at PM1 may deliver a more sensible indication of the actual air quality than the current standard of monitoring PM2.5. We found substantial differences relating to this split. PM2.5 data frequently include particles from both mechanical and combustion processes. PM1 measurements can be used to better distinguish particles derived from these two sources. We measured number concentrations of PM1 with PM2.5–1 concurrently with particle mass concentration and found that the typical average particle diameter by mass in the urban aerosols investigated was in the range of 120 nm; this corresponded well with the particle number size distributions measured in real time. Raman spectral analysis and thermal-optical evaluation of the sampled material also suggested that it would be sensible to split the measurement of the PM2.5 fraction into PM1 and PM2.5–1 size fractions, especially for analysis of carbonaceous aerosol components using the DRI thermal/optical reﬂectance carbon analysis system © 2017 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {This study aims to investigate possible sources of air pollutants and the spatial patterns within the eight selected Malaysian air monitoring stations based on a two-year database (2008e2009). The multivariate analysis was applied on the dataset. It incorporated Hierarchical Agglomerative Cluster Analysis (HACA) to access the spatial patterns, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine the major sources of the air pollution and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to assess the percentage contribution of each air pollutant. The HACA results grouped the eight monitoring stations into three different clusters, based on the characteristics of the air pollutants and meteorological parameters. The PCA analysis showed that the major sources of air pollution were emissions from motor vehicles, aircraft, industries and areas of high population density. The MLR analysis demonstrated that the main pollutant contributing to variability in the Air Pollutant Index (API) at all stations was particulate matter with a diameter of less than 10 mm (PM10). Further MLR analysis showed that the main air pollutant inﬂuencing the high concentration of PM10 was carbon monoxide (CO). This was due to combustion processes, particularly originating from motor vehicles. Meteorological factors such as ambient temperature, wind speed and humidity were also noted to inﬂuence the concentration of PM10.},

	abstract = {Ground ﬁne particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations at high spatial resolution are substantially required for determining the population exposure to PM2.5 over densely populated urban areas. However, most studies for China have generated PM2.5 estimations at a coarse resolution (!10 km) due to the limitation of satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) product in spatial resolution. In this study, the 3 km AOD data fused using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 AOD products were employed to estimate the ground PM2.5 concentrations over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region of China from January 2013 to December 2015. An improved geographically and temporally weighted regression (iGTWR) model incorporating seasonal characteristics within the data was developed, which achieved comparable performance to the standard GTWR model for the days with paired PM2.5- AOD samples (Cross-validation (CV) R2 ¼ 0.82) and showed better predictive power for the days without PM2.5- AOD pairs (the R2 increased from 0.24 to 0.46 in CV). Both iGTWR and GTWR (CV R2 ¼ 0.84) signiﬁcantly outperformed the daily geographically weighted regression model (CV R2 ¼ 0.66). Also, the fused 3 km AODs improved data availability and presented more spatial gradients, thereby enhancing model performance compared with the MODIS original 3/10 km AOD product. As a result, ground PM2.5 concentrations at higher resolution were well represented, allowing, e.g., short-term pollution events and long-term PM2.5 trend to be identiﬁed, which, in turn, indicated that concerns about air pollution in the BTH region are justiﬁed despite its decreasing trend from 2013 to 2015.},

The chemical composition of PM2.5 and PM10 was measured over a year at a street location and up- and down-wind of the city of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The 14C content in EC and OC concentrations was also determined, to distinguish the contribution from “modern” carbon (e.g., biogenic emissions, biomass burning and wildﬁres) and fossil fuel combustion. It was concluded that the urban background of PM2.5 and PM10 is dominated by the regional background, and that primary and secondary PM emission by urban sources contribute less than 15\%. The 14C analysis revealed that 70\% of OC originates from modern carbon and 30\% from fossil fuel combustion. The corresponding percentages for EC are, respectively 17\% and 83\%. It is concluded that in particular the urban population living in street canyons with intense road trafﬁc has potential health risks. This is due to exposure to elevated concentrations of a factor two for EC from exhaust emissions in PM2.5 and a factor 2e3 for heavy metals from brake and tyre wear, and re-suspended road dust in PM10. It follows that local air quality management may focus on local measures to street canyons with intense road trafﬁc.},

Since the countries with more serious problems of air pollution are the less wealthy, this study proposes an affordable method based on machine learning to estimate the concentration of PM2.5. The capital city of Ecuador is used as case study. Several regression models are built from features of different levels of affordability. The first result shows that cheap data collection based on web traffic monitoring enables us to create a model that fairly correlates traffic density with air pollution. Building multiple models according to the hourly occurrence of the pollution peaks seems to increase the accuracy of the estimation, especially in the morning hours. The second result shows that adding meteorological factors allows for a significant improvement of the prediction of PM2.5 concentrations. Nevertheless, the last finding demonstrates that the best predictive model should be based on a hybrid source of data that includes trace gases. Since the sensors to monitor such gases are costly, the last part of the chapter gives some recommendations to get an accurate prediction from models that consider no more than two trace gases.},

	abstract = {Abstract. An approach for analysis and modeling of global atmospheric chemistry is developed for application to measurements that provide a tropospheric climatology of those heterogeneously distributed, reactive species that control the loss of methane and the production and loss of ozone. We identify key species (e.g., O3, NOx, HNO3, HNO4, C2H3NO5, H2O, HOOH, CH3OOH, HCHO, CO, CH4, C2H6, acetaldehyde, acetone) and presume that they can be measured simultaneously in air parcels on the scale of a few km horizontally and a few tenths of a km vertically. As a first step, six global models have prepared such climatologies sampled at the modeled resolution for August with emphasis on the vast central Pacific Ocean basin. Objectives of this paper are to identify and characterize differences in model-generated reactivities as well as species covariances that could readily be discriminated with an unbiased climatology. A primary tool is comparison of multidimensional probability densities of key species weighted by the mass of such parcels or frequency of occurrence as well as by the reactivity of the parcels with respect to methane and ozone. The reactivity-weighted probabilities tell us which parcels matter in this case, and this method shows skill in differentiating among the models' chemistry. Testing 100 km scale models with 2 km measurements using these tools also addresses a core question about model resolution and whether fine-scale atmospheric structures matter to the overall ozone and methane budget. A new method enabling these six global chemistry–climate models to ingest an externally sourced climatology and then compute air parcel reactivity is demonstrated. Such an objective climatology containing these key species is anticipated from the NASA Atmospheric Tomography (ATom) aircraft mission (2015–2020), executing profiles over the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean basins. This modeling study addresses a core part of the design of ATom.},

The Particulate matter (PM) samples were collected from Sukhumvit road, Bangkok, Thailand, at both open (104 samples) and covered (92 samples) areas along the road. Fifteen percent of all samples were separated before the statistical models were run and used for model validation. The results from the path analysis were more elaborate than those from the linear regression, thus indicating that meteorological conditions had a direct effect on the particulate levels and that the effects of traffic flow were more variable in open areas. The model also indicated that meteorological conditions had an indirect effect and that traffic flow had a direct effect on particulate levels in covered areas. The model validation results indicated that for open areas, the R2 values were not very different between the path analysis and the linear regression model, but that the path analysis was more accurate than the linear regression model at very low PM concentrations. At high PM concentrations, the path analysis model also had a better fit than did the linear regression, so the predictions from the path analysis model were more accurate than those from the linear regression.},

The results reveal that the problem of high O3 concentration continuously persisted in this area. The O3 photolytic rate constant (j1) for BMR calculated based on assuming a photostationary state ranged from 0.008 to 0.013 s−1, which is similar to the calculated j1 using the NCAR TUV model (0.021 ± 0.0024 s−1). Interconversion between O3, NO and NO2 indicates that crossover points between the species occur when the concentration of NOx (= NO + NO2) is ∼ 60 ppb. Under a low-NOx regime ([NOx] {\textless} 60 ppb), O3 is the dominant species, while, under a high-NOx regime ([NOx] {\textgreater} 60 ppb), NO dominates. Linear regression analysis between the concentrations of Ox (= O3 + NO2) and NOx provides the role of local and regional contributions to Ox. During O3 episodes ([O3]hourly {\textgreater} 100 ppb), the values of the local and regional contributions were nearly double of those during nonepisodes. Ratio analysis suggests that the major contributors of primary pollutants over BMR are mobile sources. The air quality index (AQI) for BMR was predominantly good to moderate; however, unhealthy O3 categories were observed during episode conditions in the region.},

	abstract = {Analysis of photochemical pollution was done using the available 5-yr monitoring data (1996–2000) from 11 monitoring stations in Bangkok and 5 stations in other surrounding provinces, i.e. the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR). Status and trend of O3 as well as the monthly and diurnal variations were analyzed in relation to the local meteorological conditions as well as the regional transport of pollutants associated with the monsoon. The O3 in Bangkok was found to be typical for the polluted urban areas with a lower concentration in the city center, especially at curbside stations, and higher concentration at the downwind locations. O3 pollution was highest in 1997 with the maximum hourly average of 370 ppbv and the total hours exceeding the national hourly O3 standard (100 ppbv) of 314 h, which is most likely related to the strong El Nin* o and the forest ﬁre in Southeast Asia in this year. Meteorologyunadjusted trend shows a slight increase in O3 from 1998 to 2000. Local emission and photochemistry are mainly responsible for O3 episodes in the BMR. Seasonal ﬂuctuations of O3, however, were found to relate to the regional transport associated with the Asian monsoon. Highest O3 pollution was found in the period from January to April (winter and local summer) and lowest during mid-rainy season, August. The O3 increase isopleth diagram was constructed which shows that O3 production in BMR is effective when the NOx/NMHC ratio is in the range of 0.04–0.15 with optimum ratio of around 0.07. Seasonal variations in NOx/NMHC ratios are consistent with the O3 variations, i.e., optimum in summer (0.07), followed by winter (0.05), and the lowest in rainy season (0.03).},

The Bangkok air quality and meteorological data used in this study were collected by the Pollution Control Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Thailand, during 1996–2009. Measurements of hourly air quality and meteorological data were derived from 10 residential and seven roadside sites. Pearson’s chi-square cross tabulation statistics show that the 24-hour mean PM10 concentrations at both roadside and residential sites were to be significantly higher than the Thai National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The daily 1-hour maximum O3 (O3-1hr) concentration was higher than the Thai NAAQS at both sites. However, the concentrations of 8-hour time-weighting average of CO (CO8hr) were lower than the Thai NAAQS at both sites. The 24-hour average SO2 concentration and the daily 1-hour mean concentration of NO2 were higher than the WHO guidelines, but complied with the Thai NAAQS at both sites. A stepwise multiple linear regression model was used to analyze the significant factors affecting PM10, CO8hr, O3-1hr, NO2, and SO2 levels at both sites, and the results showed a decreased association with meteorological parameters and an increased association with the area studied and seasons. In contrast, O3-1hr levels exhibited a decreased association with the area studied. This study found that traffic emissions are the major factor causing the spatial variation in air pollutants in BKK, Thailand, while the meteorological parameters might be the main factors that affect the temporal variations. Our findings show the heterogeneously spatiotemporal characteristics of air pollution in BKK, and can be used to help mitigate this problem.},

	abstract = {Continuous detection of dispersion and residence of volcanic plumes in troposphere and lower stratosphere is vitally important for improving the understanding on the role of volcano eruptions in climate change. We report a 3-month continuous detection of dispersion and residence of volcanic plumes in the troposphere and stratosphere generated from the volcanic SO2 erupted by Nabro in Eritrea on June 12th, 2011 observed by the OMI sensor. The background SO2 concentration of 3 diﬀerent height layers in troposphere and lower stratosphere were estimated by the 3-year-average daily concentration of monthly SO2 in 2005, 2007 and 2013, when there were no large explosive volcanic eruptions occurring. We also traced the diﬀusion path and the concentration of volcanic SO2 for the ﬁrst 3 months after Nabro's eruption, and detected the appearance and dissipation of sulfate aerosols, which is a product converted from volcanic SO2. The results show that after Nabro erupted on June 12th, the volcanic plumes spread to middle latitudes (30°N-60°N) of Northern Hemisphere and loading by westerly jet. The volcanic SO2 in middle troposphere layer (TRM) and lower troposphere layer (TRL) stopped eastward spreading, and dissipated over the western Paciﬁc Ocean on June 23rd. On June 26th, the volcanic SO2 in upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (STL) reached Mexico in Central America, and almost encircled the low latitudes and parts of middle latitudes. On June 28th, the volcanic SO2 plume showed an even distribution in STL. 37 days after the eruption, the volcanic SO2 in STL encircled the Northern Hemisphere evenly, sulfate aerosols in STL largely covered the low and middle latitudes and the daily concentration of SO2 was still higher than the background value. One month after the eruption, the global mean daily concentration of SO2 dropped to the normal value, but the daily concentration of SO2 and sulfate aerosols in low latitudes remained high, and dissipated not earlier than 3 months after the eruption of Nabro.},

Observations of the temporal variation of SO*, SO:- and V concentrations in the North American and Norwegian Arctic are presented. At Igloolik, Canada, 3-7-day average SOz concentrations ranged from 2.3 to 4.3 pg m-’ in February to much lower values in spring and fall. The most probable cause of similar strong variations in the ratio of SOi- to V observed throughout the North American Arctic is a seasonally varying SO1 oxidation rate. Interpreted in the light of a Lagrangian transport model, observations indicate that the mean SO,-oxidation rate between Eurasian sources and the North American Arctic is 0.1\% h - ’ in early December, 0.04 \% h - ’ in late February, and 0.14.2 \% h- 1in early April. The residence time of SOr, controlled not only by chemical conversion to sulphate but also by dry deposition, is 14-20 days in late fall, 16-32 days at mid-winter and 10-19 days in April. The estimated rates of SO1 oxidation cannot be explained by photochemical oxidation mechanisms at least when reactive hydrocarbons are ignored.},

Attribution of climate variability to volcanic activity is of particular interest in relation to the post-2000 slowing in the rate of global average temperature increases. We have compiled a database of volcanic SO2 emissions and plume altitudes for eruptions from 1990 to 2014 and developed a new prognostic capability for simulating stratospheric sulfate aerosols in the Community Earth System Model. We used these combined with other nonvolcanic emissions of sulfur sources to reconstruct global aerosol properties from 1990 to 2014. Our calculations show remarkable agreement with ground-based lidar observations of stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD) and with in situ measurements of stratospheric aerosol surface area density (SAD). These properties are key parameters in calculating the radiative and chemical effects of stratospheric aerosols. Our SAOD calculations represent a clear improvement over available satellite-based analyses, which generally ignore aerosol extinction below 15 km, a region that can contain the vast majority of stratospheric aerosol extinction at middle and high latitudes. Our SAD calculations greatly improve on that provided for the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative, which misses about 60\% of the SAD measured in situ on average during both volcanically active and volcanically quiescent periods.},

	abstract = {SO2 and H2S are the two most important gas-phase sulfur species emitted by volcanoes, with a global amount from non-explosive emissions of the order 10 Tg-S/yr. These gases are readily oxidized forming SO42´ aerosols, which effectively scatter the incoming solar radiation and cool the surface. They also perturb atmospheric chemistry by enhancing the NOx to HNO3 heterogeneous conversion via hydrolysis on the aerosol surface of N2O5 and Br-Cl nitrates. This reduces formation of tropospheric O3 and the OH to HO2 ratio, thus limiting the oxidation of CH4 and increasing its lifetime. In addition to this tropospheric chemistry perturbation, there is also an impact on the NOx heterogeneous chemistry in the lower stratosphere, due to vertical transport of volcanic SO2 up to the tropical tropopause layer. Furthermore, the stratospheric O3 formation and loss, as well as the NOx budget, may be slightly affected by the additional amount of upward diffused solar radiation and consequent increase of photolysis rates. Two multi-decadal time-slice runs of a climate-chemistry-aerosol model have been designed for studying these chemical-radiative effects. A tropopause mean global net radiative ﬂux change (RF) of ´0.23 W¨m´2 is calculated (including direct and indirect aerosol effects) with a 14\% increase of the global mean sulfate aerosol optical depth. A 5–15 ppt NOx decrease is found in the mid-troposphere subtropics and mid-latitudes and also from pole to pole in the lower stratosphere. The tropospheric NOx perturbation triggers a column O3 decrease of 0.5–1.5 DU and a 1.1\% increase of the CH4 lifetime. The surface cooling induced by solar radiation scattering by the volcanic aerosols induces a tropospheric stabilization with reduced updraft velocities that produce ice supersaturation conditions in the upper troposphere. A global mean 0.9\% decrease of the cirrus ice optical depth is calculated with an indirect RF of ´0.08 W¨m´2.},

	abstract = {A recent paper by Essenhigh (Essenhigh, R. H. Energy Fuels 2009, 23, 2773À2784) (hereafter ES09) concludes that the relatively short residence time of CO2 in the atmosphere (5À15 years) establishes that the long-term (≈100 year) rise in atmospheric concentration is not due to anthropogenic emissions but is instead caused by an environmental response to rising atmospheric temperature, which is attributed in ES09 to “other natural factors”. Clearly, if true, the economic and political signiﬁcance of that conclusion would be self-evident and indeed most welcome. Unfortunately, however, the conclusion is false; it is straightforward to show, with considerable certainty, that the natural environment has acted as a net carbon sink throughout the industrial era, taking in signiﬁcantly more carbon than it has emitted, and therefore, the observed rise in atmospheric CO2 cannot be a natural phenomenon. The carbon cycle includes exchange ﬂuxes that constantly redistribute vast quantities of CO2 each year between the atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial reservoirs. As a result, the residence time, which depends upon the total volume of these ﬂuxes, is short. However, the rate at which atmospheric concentrations rise or fall depends upon the net diﬀerence between ﬂuxes into and out of the atmosphere, rather than their total volume, and therefore, the long-term rise is essentially independent of the residence time. The aim of this paper is to provide an accessible explanation of why the short residence time of CO2 in the atmosphere is completely consistent with the generally accepted anthropogenic origin of the observed post-industrial rise in atmospheric concentration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the one-box model of the carbon cycle used in ES09 directly gives rise to (i) a short residence time of ≈4 years, (ii) a long adjustment time of ≈74 years, (iii) a constant airborne fraction, of ≈58\%, in response to exponential growth in anthropogenic emissions, and (iv) a very low value for the expected proportion of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere. This is achieved without environmental uptake ever falling below environmental emissions and, hence, is consistent with the generally accepted anthropogenic origin of the post-industrial increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric turbulence is a major hazard in the aviation industry and can cause injuries to passengers and crew. Understanding the physical and dynamical generation mechanisms of turbulence aids with the development of new forecasting algorithms and, therefore, reduces the impact that it has on the aviation industry. The scope of this paper is to review the dynamics of aviation turbulence, its response to climate change, and current forecasting methods at the cruising altitude of aircraft. Aviationaffecting turbulence comes from three main sources: vertical wind shear instabilities, convection, and mountain waves. Understanding these features helps researchers to develop better turbulence diagnostics. Recent research suggests that turbulence will increase in frequency and strength with climate change, and therefore, turbulence forecasting may become more important in the future. The current methods of forecasting are unable to predict every turbulence event, and research is ongoing to ﬁnd the best solution to this problem by combining turbulence predictors and using ensemble forecasts to increase skill. The skill of operational turbulence forecasts has increased steadily over recent decades, mirroring improvements in our understanding. However, more work is needed—ideally in collaboration with the aviation industry—to improve observations and increase forecast skill, to help maintain and enhance aviation safety standards in the future.},

We present a variety of conﬁgurations for the representation of tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry, wet removal, and online and ofﬂine meteorology. Results from simulations illustrating these conﬁgurations are compared with surface, aircraft and satellite observations. Major biases include a negative bias in the high-latitude CO distribution, a positive bias in uppertropospheric/lower-stratospheric ozone, and a positive bias in summertime surface ozone (over the United States and Europe). The tropospheric net chemical ozone production varies signiﬁcantly between conﬁgurations, partly related to variations in stratosphere-troposphere exchange. Aerosol optical depth tends to be underestimated over most regions, while comparison with aerosol surface measurements over the United States indicate reasonable results for sulfate , especially in the online simulation. Other aerosol species exhibit signiﬁcant biases. Overall, the model-data comparison indicates that the ofﬂine simulation driven by GEOS5 meteorological analyses provides the best simulation, possibly due in part to the increased vertical resolution (52 levels instead of 26 for online dynamics).

	abstract = {We present new insights into the evolution and interactions of stratospheric aerosol using an updated version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM). Improved horizontal resolution, dynamics, and chemistry now produce an internally generated quasi-biennial oscillation and signiﬁcant improvements to stratospheric temperatures and ozone compared to observations. We present a validation of WACCM column ozone and climate calculations against observations. The prognostic treatment of stratospheric sulfate aerosols accurately represents the evolution of stratospheric aerosol optical depth and perturbations to solar and longwave radiation following the June 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. We conﬁrm the inclusion of interactive OH chemistry as an important factor in the formation and initial distribution of aerosol following large inputs of sulfur dioxide (SO2) to the stratosphere. We calculate that depletion of OH levels within the dense SO2 cloud in the ﬁrst weeks following the Pinatubo eruption signiﬁcantly prolonged the average initial e-folding decay time for SO2 oxidation to 47 days. Previous observational and model studies showing a 30 day decay time have not accounted for the large (30–55\%) losses of SO2 on ash and ice within 7–9 days posteruption and have not correctly accounted for OH depletion. We examine the variability of aerosol evolution in free-running climate simulations due to meteorology, with comparison to simulations nudged with speciﬁed dynamics. We assess calculated impacts of volcanic aerosols on ozone loss with comparisons to observations. The completeness of the chemistry, dynamics, and aerosol microphysics in WACCM qualify it for studies of stratospheric sulfate aerosol geoengineering. Plain Language Summary Stratospheric aerosols form after volcanoes inject SO2 into the stratosphere, and can cool global surface temperatures. A new capability for simulating stratospheric aerosols from SO2 injections in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model is shown to reproduce well observed climate and chemistry responses. The ability of the model to calculate accurately the reductions in sunlight and losses of ozone that have been observed following historical eruptions in the satellite era gives strong conﬁdence in the model’s ability to simulate such responses to potential future deliberate injections of SO2 to offset global warming. Such responses to geoengineering are presented in a series of companion papers.},

The model has been evaluated against UK measurement data and been shown to adequately represent the observed PM10 at rural and urban sites on a daily basis. The Lagrangian nature of the model allows information on the origin of pollutants (and hence their secondary products) to be retained to allow attribution of pollutants at receptor sites back to their sources. This source apportionment technique has been employed to determine whether the different components of the modelled PM10 have originated from UK, shipping, European (excluding the UK) or background sources. For the first time this has been done to evaluate the composition during periods of elevated PM10 as well as the annual average composition. The episode data were determined by selecting the model data for each hour when the corresponding measurement data was {\textgreater}50 μg/m3. All the modelled sites show an increase in European pollution contribution and a decrease in the background contribution in the episode case compared to the annual average. The European contribution is greatest in southern and eastern parts of the UK and decreases moving northwards and westwards. Analysis of the speciated attribution data over the selected sites reveals that for 2008, as an annual average, the top three contributors to total PM10 are UK primary PM10 (17–25\%), UK origin nitrate aerosol (18–21\%) and background PM10 (11–16\%). Under episode conditions the top three contributors to modelled PM10 are UK origin nitrate aerosol (12–33\%), European origin nitrate aerosol (11–19\%) and UK primary PM10 (12–18\%).},

The SO2 cloud observed by the TOMS encircled the Earth in about 22 days (∼21 m/s); however, during the first three days the leading edge of the SO2 cloud moved with a speed that averaged ∼35 m/s. Compared to the 1982 El Chichón eruptions, Pinatubo outgassed nearly three times the amount of SO2 during its explosive phases. The main cloud straddled the equator within the first two weeks of eruption, whereas the El Chichón cloud remained primarily in the northern hemisphere. Our measurements indicate that Mount Pinatubo has produced a much larger and perhaps longer-lasting SO2 cloud; thus, climatic responses to the Pinatubo eruption may exceed those of El Chichón.},

The central aim of ISA-MIP is to constrain and improve interactive stratospheric aerosol models and reduce uncertainties in the stratospheric aerosol forcing by comparing results of standardized model experiments with a range of observations. In this paper we present four co-ordinated inter-model experiments designed to investigate key processes which influence the formation and temporal development of stratospheric aerosol in different time periods of the observational record. The Background (BG) experiment will focus on microphysics and transport processes under volcanically quiescent conditions, when the stratospheric aerosol is controlled by the transport of aerosols and their precursors from the troposphere to the stratosphere.

	abstract = {Dry deposition is an important removal process controlling surface ozone. We examine the representation of this ozone loss mechanism in the Community Earth System Model. We first correct the dry deposition parameterization by coupling the leaf and stomatal vegetation resistances to the leaf area index, an omission which has adversely impacted over a decade of ozone simulations using both the Model for Ozone and Related chemical Tracers (MOZART) and Community Atmospheric Model-Chem (CAM-Chem) global models. We show that this correction increases O3 dry deposition velocities over vegetated regions and improves the simulated seasonality in this loss process. This enhanced removal reduces the previously reported bias in summertime surface O3 simulated over eastern U.S. and Europe. We further optimize the parameterization by scaling down the stomatal resistance used in the Community Land Model to observed values. This in turn further improves the simulation of dry deposition velocity of O3, particularly over broadleaf forested regions. The summertime surface O3 bias is reduced from 30 ppb to 14 ppb over eastern U.S. and 13 ppb to 5 ppb over Europe from the standard to the optimized scheme, respectively. O3 deposition processes must therefore be accurately coupled to vegetation phenology within 3-D atmospheric models, as a first step toward improving surface O3 and simulating O3 responses to future and past vegetation changes.},

The main focus of this paper is to compare the performance of configurations with internally derived "free running" (FR) meteorology and "specified dynamics" (SD) against observations from surface, aircraft, and satellite, as well as understand the origin of the identified differences. We focus on the representation of aerosols and chemistry. All model configurations reproduce tropospheric ozone for most regions based on in situ and satellite observations. However, shortcomings exist in the representation of ozone precursors and aerosols. Tropospheric ozone in all model configurations agrees for the most part with ozonesondes and satellite observations in the tropics and the Northern Hemisphere within the variability of the observations. Southern hemispheric tropospheric ozone is consistently underestimated by up to 25\%. Differences in convection and stratosphere to troposphere exchange processes are mostly responsible for differences in ozone in the different model configurations. Carbon monoxide (CO) and other volatile organic compounds are largely underestimated in Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes based on satellite and aircraft observations. Nitrogen oxides (NO$_{\textrm{\textit{x}}}$) are biased low in the free tropical troposphere, whereas peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) is overestimated in particular in high northern latitudes. The present-day methane lifetime estimates are compared among the different model configurations. These range between 7.8 years in the SD configuration of CAM5-chem and 8.8 years in the FR configuration of CAM4-chem and are therefore underestimated compared to observational estimations. We find that differences in tropospheric aerosol surface area between CAM4 and CAM5 play an important role in controlling the burden of the tropical tropospheric hydroxyl radical (OH), which causes differences in tropical methane lifetime of about half a year between CAM4-chem and CAM5-chem. In addition, different distributions of NO$_{\textrm{\textit{x}}}$ from lightning explain about half of the difference between SD and FR model versions in both CAM4-chem and CAM5-chem. Remaining differences in the tropical OH burden are due to enhanced tropical ozone burden in SD configurations compared to the FR versions, which are not only caused by differences in chemical production or loss but also by transport and mixing. For future studies, we recommend the use of CAM5-chem configurations, due to improved aerosol description and inclusion of aerosol–cloud interactions. However, smaller tropospheric surface area density in the current version of CAM5-chem compared to CAM4-chem results in larger oxidizing capacity in the troposphere and therefore a shorter methane lifetime.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {It is well accepted that the climate impact of large explosive volcanic eruptions results from reduction of solar radiation following atmospheric conversion of magmatic SO2 emissions into H2SO4 aerosols. Thus, understanding the fate of SO2 in the eruption plume is crucial for better assessing volcanic forcing of climate. Here we focus on the potential of tephra to interact with and remove SO2 gas from the eruptive plume. Scavenging of SO2 by tephra is generally assumed to be driven by in-plume, low-temperature reactions between H2SO4 condensates and tephra particles. However, the importance of SO2 gas–tephra interaction above the dew point temperature of H2SO4 (190–200 °C) has never been constrained. Here we report the results of an experimental study where silicate glasses with representative volcanic compositions were exposed to SO2 in the temperature range 25–800 °C. We show that above 600 °C, the uptake of SO2 on glass exhibits optimal eﬃciency and emplaces surﬁcial CaSO4 deposits. This reaction is sustained via Ca2+ diﬀusion from the bulk to the surface of the glass particles. At 800 °C, the diﬀusion coeﬃcient for Ca2+ in the glasses was in the range 10À13–10À14 cm2 sÀ1. We suggest that high temperature SO2 scavenging by glass-rich tephra proceeds by the same Ca2+ diﬀusion-driven mechanism. Using a simple mathematical model, we estimated SO2 scavenging eﬃciencies at 800 °C varying from {\textless}1\% to 73\%, depending mainly on exposure time and tephra matrix glass Ca2+ content. Our results imply that large explosive eruptions with a deep magma fragmentation depth are likely to be aﬀected by signiﬁcant gas–tephra interaction at temperature above 600 °C. This SO2 sequestration mechanism should be considered when constraining volcanic S budgets, and when coupling the initial magmatic SO2 content and the induced climatic response in some of the Earth’s largest eruptions.},

While airborne particles provide solid surfaces for chemical reactions with trace gases in the atmosphere, the reactivity of airborne ash has seldom been investigated. Here we determine the total uptake capacity (NiM) and initial uptake coefﬁcient (γM) for sulfur dioxide (SO2) and ozone (O3) on a compositional array of volcanic ash and glass powders at {\textasciitilde}25°C in a Knudsen ﬂow reactor. The measured ranges of NiSO2 and γSO2 (1011–1013 molecules cmÀ2 and 10À3–10À2) and NiO3 and γO3 (1012–1013 molecules cmÀ2 and 10À3–10À2) are comparable to values reported for mineral dust. Differences in ash and glass reactivity toward SO2 and O3 may relate to varying abundances of, respectively, basic and reducing sites on these materials. The typically lower SO2 and O3 uptake on ash compared to glass likely results from prior exposure of ash surfaces to acidic and oxidizing conditions within the volcanic eruption plume/cloud. While sequential uptake experiments overall suggest that these gases do not compete for reactive surface sites, SO2 uptake forming adsorbed S(IV) species may enhance the capacity for subsequent O3 uptake via redox reaction forming adsorbed S(VI) species. Our ﬁndings imply that ash emissions may represent a hitherto neglected sink for atmospheric SO2 and O3.},

	abstract = {This study examines the sensitivity of atmospheric dispersion model forecasts of volcanic ash clouds to the physical characteristics assigned to the particles. We show that the particle size distribution (PSD) used to initialise a dispersion model has a significant impact on the forecast of the mass loading of the ash particles in the atmosphere. This is because the modeled fall velocity of the particles is sensitive to the particle diameter. Forecasts of the long-range transport of the ash cloud consider particles with diameters between 0.1 μm and 100 μm. The fall velocity of particles with diameter 100 μm is over 5 orders of magnitude greater than a particle with diameter 0.1 μm, and 30 μm particles fall 88\% slower and travel up to 5× further than a 100 μm particle. Identifying the PSD of the ash cloud at the source, which is required to initialise a model, is difficult. Further, aggregation processes are currently not explicitly modeled in operational dispersion models due to the high computational costs associated with aggregation schemes. We show that using a modified total grain size distribution (TGSD) that effectively accounts for aggregation processes improves the modeled PSD of the ash cloud and deposits from the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull in 2010. Knowledge of the TGSD of an eruption is therefore critical for reducing uncertainty in quantitative forecasts of ash cloud dispersion. The density and shape assigned to the model particles have a lesser but still significant impact on the calculated fall velocity. Accounting for the density distribution and sphericity of ash from the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull in 2010, modeled particles can travel up to 84\% further than particles with default particle characteristics that assume the particles are spherical and have a fixed density.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Tropical volcanic eruptions have been widely studied for their significant contribution to stratospheric aerosol loading and global climate impacts, but the impact of high-latitude volcanic eruptions on the stratospheric aerosol layer is not clear and the pathway of transporting aerosol from high latitudes to the tropical stratosphere is not well understood. In this work, we focus on the high-latitude volcano Sarychev (48.1° N, 153.2° E), which erupted in June 2009, and the influence of the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) on the equatorward dispersion of the volcanic plume. First, the sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission time series and plume height of the Sarychev eruption are estimated with SO2 observations of the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and a backward trajectory approach using the Lagrangian particle dispersion model Massive–Parallel Trajectory Calculations (MPTRAC). Then, the transport and dispersion of the plume are simulated using the derived SO2 emission time series. The transport simulations are compared with SO2 observations from AIRS and validated with aerosol observations from the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS). The MPTRAC simulations show that about 4 \% of the sulfur emissions were transported to the tropical stratosphere within 50 days after the beginning of the eruption, and the plume dispersed towards the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) through isentropic transport above the subtropical jet. The MPTRAC simulations and MIPAS aerosol data both show that between the potential temperature levels of 360 and 400 K, the equatorward transport was primarily driven by anticyclonic Rossby wave breaking enhanced by the ASM in boreal summer. The volcanic plume was entrained along the anticyclone flows and reached the TTL as it was transported southwestwards into the deep tropics downstream of the anticyclone. Further, the ASM anticyclone influenced the pathway of aerosols by isolating an aerosol hole inside of the ASM, which was surrounded by aerosol-rich air outside. This transport barrier was best indicated using the potential vorticity gradient approach. Long-term MIPAS aerosol detections show that after entering the TTL, aerosol from the Sarychev eruption remained in the tropical stratosphere for about 10 months and ascended slowly. The ascent speed agreed well with the ascent speed of the water vapor tape recorder. Furthermore, a hypothetical MPTRAC simulation for a wintertime eruption was carried out. It is shown that under winter atmospheric circulations, the equatorward transport of the plume would be suppressed by the strong subtropical jet and weak wave breaking events. In this hypothetical scenario, a high-latitude volcanic eruption would not be able to contribute to the tropical stratospheric aerosol layer.},

	abstract = {ICAO’s Annual Report of the Council provides the world aviation community with comprehensive insight into the yearly programmes, activities and achievements of the Organization. These are pursued in support of ICAO’s Strategic Objectives and the mission defined for it by the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention).

 

The Preamble to the Convention clearly reflects that its signatory (ICAO Member) States have agreed on principles and arrangements supporting the safe and orderly development of international civil aviation, with the complementary aim that international air transport services should be operated soundly and economically and established on the basis of equality of opportunity.

	abstract = {Remote sensing instruments have been used to identify, track and in some cases quantify atmospheric constituents from space-borne platforms for nearly 30 years. These data have proven to be extremely useful for detecting hazardous ash and gas (principally SO2) clouds emitted by volcanoes and which have the potential to intersect global air routes. The remoteness of volcanoes, the sporadic timings of eruptions and the ability of the upper atmosphere winds to quickly spread ash and gas, make satellite remote sensing a key tool for developing hazard warning systems. It is easily recognized how powerful these tools are for hazard detection and yet there has not been a single instrument designed specifically for this use. Instead, researchers have had to make use of instruments and data designed for other purposes. In this article the satellite instruments, algorithms and techniques used for ash and gas detection are described from a historical perspective with a view to elucidating their value and shortcomings. Volcanic clouds residing in the mid- to upper-troposphere (heights above 5 km) have the greatest potential of intersecting air routes and can be dispersed over many 1,000s of kilometres by the prevailing winds. Global air traffic vulnerability to the threat posed by volcanic clouds is then considered from the perspectives of satellite remote sensing, the upper troposphere mean wind circulation, and current and forecast air traffic density based on an up-to-date aircraft emissions inventory. It is concluded that aviation in the Asia Pacific region will be increasingly vulnerable to volcanic cloud encounters because of the large number of active volcanoes in the region and the increasing growth rate of air traffic in that region. It is also noted that should high-speed civil transport (HSCT) aircraft become operational, there will be an increased risk to volcanic debris that is far from its source location. This vulnerability is highlighted using air traffic density maps based on NOx emissions and satellite SO2 observations of the spread of volcanic clouds.},

	abstract = {The adsorption of pure sulfur dioxide gas on volcanic ashes has been studied from 0.1 mbar to 1 bar and from –80 to +150 °C. Finely ground synthetic glasses of andesitic, dacitic, and rhyolitic composition served as proxies for fresh natural ash surfaces. Powders from two natural obsidian samples were also studied and yielded results broadly similar to the synthetic model systems. SO2 adsorption on ash is partially irreversible; it appears that the first layer of SO2 molecules absorbed on the surface cannot be removed. The pressure and temperature dependence of adsorption can be described by the equation lnc = A T-1 + B lnP + C, where c is the surface concentration of adsorbed SO2 in mg/m2, T is temperature in Kelvin, and P is the partial pressure of SO2 in mbar. A multiple regression analysis of the experimental data yielded A = 1645, B = 0.29, C = –7.43 for andesite, A = 2140, B = 0.29, C = –9.32 for dacite, and A = 910, B = 0.21, C = –4.48 for rhyolite. These data imply that adsorption strongly decreases with temperature, but only slowly decreases with decreasing partial pressure of SO2. Therefore, adsorption primarily occurs in the cool and diluted parts of the volcanic plume. Model calculations show that most of the SO2 may be removed from the plume, if the initial SO2 concentration in the volcanic gases is low and the surface area of the ash is high. For high initial SO2 concentrations, the fraction of SO2 that is lost by adsorption decreases, since the amount of SO2 in the gas phase is proportional to the SO2 partial pressure P, while adsorption is proportional only to P0.2 – P0.3. Adsorption of SO2 on ash particles may therefore be one reason why the climatic impact of explosive volcanic eruptions does not always scale with total sulfur yield.},

	abstract = {On August 16, 2014, an intense seismic swarm started below the eastern part of Bárðarbunga caldera in the north-western part of Vatnajökull ice cap, Iceland, marking the onset of a major rifting event. The intense seismicity, corroborated by a complicated deformation pattern, migrated away from the Bárðarbunga caldera for N45 km, until a small effusive eruption started in Holuhraun, outside of the ice cap, on August 29 which lasted a few hours. On August 31 a second, more intense, eruption started. It lasted 180 days and is the largest effusive eruption in Iceland since the Laki event in 1783–1784. A lava ﬁeld covered about 84 km2 in the middle of the highlands with a bulk volume of {\textasciitilde}1.44 km3. Although the potential danger of ice melting and subsequent ﬂooding coupled with tephra fallout was the main concern at the beginning of the crisis, the main associated hazard turned out to be an abundant and constant release of volcanic gases that polluted the country threatening human health and the environment for several months. Very little (or almost no) ash was produced. The impact of the Holuhraun eruption outside of Iceland was minor if compared with what happened in 2010 when Eyjafjallajökull erupted. However, on three occasions the dense gas cloud released by the ﬁssure eruption reached some European countries where unusually high SO2 concentrations were measured at ground level. Managing and living with such a prolonged effusive event was a major effort for the Icelandic scientiﬁc community and civil protection authorities and it signiﬁcantly affected the local population in the northern and eastern parts of the country.},

	abstract = {An alert-level system for communicating volcano hazard information to the aviation industry was devised by the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) during the 1989–1990 eruption of Redoubt Volcano. The system uses a simple, color-coded ranking that focuses on volcanic ash emissions: Green—normal background; Yellow—signs of unrest; Orange—precursory unrest or minor ash eruption; Red—major ash eruption imminent or underway. The color code has been successfully applied on a regional scale in Alaska for a sustained period. During 2002–2011, elevated color codes were assigned by AVO to 13 volcanoes, eight of which erupted; for that decade, one or more Alaskan volcanoes were at Yellow on 67 \% of days and at Orange or Red on 12 \% of days. As evidence of its utility, the color code system is integrated into procedures of agencies responsible for air-trafﬁc management and aviation meteorology in Alaska. Furthermore, it is endorsed as a key part of globally coordinated protocols established by the International Civil Aviation Organization to provide warnings of ash hazards to aviation worldwide. The color code and accompanying structured message (called a Volcano Observatory Notice for Aviation) comprise an effective early-warning message system according to the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction. The aviation color code system currently is used in the United States, Russia, New Zealand, Iceland, and partially in the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, and Indonesia. Although there are some barriers to implementation, with continued education and outreach to Volcano Observatories worldwide, greater use of the aviation color code system is achievable.},

A climate model which also covers the middle atmosphere is forced with background conditions representative of the Younger Dryas period. The Laacher See eruption is simulated by the injection of 15 Mt of SO2 to the lower stratosphere. The resulting sulfate loading in the stratosphere is comparable with post-Pinatubo (1991) observations, but clearly restricted to the Northern Hemisphere. The sulfate aerosol decays with an e-folding time of approximately 11 months, that is, also similar to recent observations. The high concentration of aerosol in the high latitudes leads to strongly intensified cooling in the polar night and to an intensified polar vortex. This produces midlatitude “continental winter warming” in the troposphere as observed after tropical eruptions. After tropical eruptions, strong absorption of terrestrial and near-infrared solar radiation in the lower latitudes is responsible for the strengthening of the polar vortex. However, for midlatitude and high-latitude eruptions it is the intense irradiance of longwave radiation from the aerosol-containing layer at polar latitudes that produces the meridional thermal gradient enhancing the polar vortex.},

	abstract = {The effect of wind changes on aircraft routing has been identified as a potential impact of climate change on aviation. This is of particular interest for trans-Atlantic flights, where the pattern of upper-level winds over the north Atlantic, in particular the location and strength of the jet stream, strongly influences both the optimal flight route and the resulting flight time. Eastbound trans-Atlantic flights can often be routed to take advantage of the strong tailwinds in the jet stream, shortening the flight time and reducing fuel consumption. Here we investigate the impact of climate change on upper-level winds over the north Atlantic, using five climate model simulations from the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, considering a high greenhouse-gas emissions scenario. The impact on aircraft routing and flight time are quantified using flight routing software. The climate models agree that the jet stream will be on average located 1° further north, with a small increase in mean strength, by 2100. However daily variations in both its location and speed are significantly larger than the magnitude of any changes due to climate change. The net effect of climate change on trans-Atlantic aircraft routes is small; in the annual-mean eastbound routes are 1min shorter and located further north and westbound routes are 1min longer and more spread out around the great circle. There are, however, seasonal variations; route time changes are larger in winter, while in summer both eastbound and westbound route times increase.},

The severity of the disruption was surprising as previous research suggests that this type of network should be tolerant to random hazard (Albert et al. in Nature 406(6794):378–382, 2000; Strogatz in Nature 410(6825):268–276, 2001). The source of this hazard tolerance lies in the degree distribution of the network which, for many real-world networks, has been shown to follow a power law (Albert et al. in Nature 401(6749):130–131, 1999; Albert et al. in Nature 406(6794):378–382, 2000). In this paper, we demonstrate that the ash cloud was unexpectedly disruptive because it was spatially coherent rather than uniformly random. We analyse the spatial dependence in air trafﬁc networks and demonstrate how the combination of their geographical distribution and their network architectures jeopardises their inherent hazard tolerance.},

There have been a number of papers on ship-routeing; they were reviewed by Motte and Calvert (1988). It should be noted that whereas for aircraft the dominant consideration is the wind (for which the maritime equivalent is the current), ship-routeing on the trans-oceanic scale is dominated by considerations of waves. However, on smaller scales, currents can be the dominant consideration: for example, see the paper by Fales (1991). That paper does not make use of the basic theory that was applied to the aeronautical problem in the 1940s. Although the work reported here is orientated to aeronautical applications, it clearly has ramifications for certain maritime problems.},

	abstract = {A study has been undertaken to determine whether there are useable incremental benefits from providing upper air wind data at high horizontal resolution to the process of airline flight planning. Currently winds are provided on a horizontal resolution of approximately 140 km. The study looked at resolutions varying between 160 and 40 km. A theoretical calculation was undertaken using published variance power spectra, which quantify the wind variability as a function of horizontal scale. This calculation also used a published formula for the time saving in flying across an area of constant vorticity. The results of the theoretical calculation were expressed in terms of the time saving on a transatlantic flight lasting typically 8 h stemming from a resolution change from 160 to 80 km. In this case the answer was well under one second. It is thought that such a small incremental benefit could not be used to justify the practical steps needed to exploit high resolution data. The more practical part of the study involved running an optimum routes diagnosis package with variable resolution input data. Input data at resolutions of 160 and 40 km were considered. Although this approach was only applied to a restricted number of cases and routes, it confirmed the theoretical result. © Crown Copyright 2007.

	abstract = {Daily weather patterns over the North Atlantic are classified into relevant types: typical weather patterns that may characterize the range of climate impacts from aviation in this region, for both summer and winter. The motivation is to provide a set of weather types to facilitate an investigation of climate-optimal aircraft routing of trans-Atlantic flights (minimizing the climate impact on a flight-by-flight basis). Using the New York to London route as an example, the time-optimal route times are shown to vary by over 60 min, to take advantage of strong tailwinds or avoid headwinds, and for eastbound routes latitude correlates well with the latitude of the jet stream. The weather patterns are classified by their similarity to the North Atlantic Oscillation and East Atlantic teleconnection patterns. For winter, five types are defined; in summer, when there is less variation in jet latitude, only three types are defined. The types can be characterized by the jet strength and position, and therefore the location of the time-optimal routes varies by type. Simple proxies for the climate impact of carbon dioxide, ozone, water vapour and contrails are defined, which depend on parameters such as the route time, latitude and season, the time spent flying in the stratosphere, and the distance over which the air is supersaturated with respect to ice. These proxies are then shown to vary between weather types and between eastbound and westbound routes. Copyright © 2012 Royal Meteorological Society},

	abstract = {Social scientists typically devote considerable eﬀort to mitigating measurement error during data collection but then ignore the issue during data analysis. Although many statistical methods have been proposed for reducing measurement error-induced biases, few have been widely used because of implausible assumptions, high levels of model dependence, diﬃcult computation, or inapplicability with multiple mismeasured variables. We develop an easy-to-use alternative without these problems; it generalizes the popular multiple imputation (mi) framework by treating missing data problems as a special case of extreme measurement error and corrects for both. Like mi, the proposed “multiple overimputation” (mo) framework is a simple two-step procedure. First, multiple (≈ 5) completed copies of the data set are created where cells measured without error are held constant, those missing are imputed from the distribution of predicted values, and cells (or entire variables) with measurement error are “overimputed,” that is imputed from the predictive distribution with observation-level priors deﬁned by the mismeasured values and available external information, if any. In the second step, analysts can then run whatever statistical method they would have run on each of the overimputed data sets as if there had been no missingness or measurement error; the results are then combined via a simple averaging procedure. With this paper, we oﬀer open source software that implements all the methods described herein.},

	abstract = {Urban air pollution resulting from traffic is a major problem in many cities in Asia, including Bangkok, Thailand. This pollution originates mainly from incomplete fossil fuel combustion, e.g. transportation, and the composition of which is very complex. Some of the compounds are carcinogenic in experimental animals and in man. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and benzene are among the major carcinogenic compounds found in urban air pollution from motor vehicle emissions. In major cities in Asia, the levels of PAHs and benzene are relatively high compared with those in Europe or in the United States and thus people are exposed to higher levels. Biomarkers of exposure and early biological effects have been used to study the potential health effects of exposure to PAHs and benzene in air pollution in school children attending schools in inner-city Bangkok compared to those attending schools in rural areas. Bangkok school children are exposed to total PAHs at levels 3.5-fold higher than those in the rural area. Urinary 1-hydroxypyrene, a metabolite of PAH, was also significantly higher, while PAH–DNA adducts in lymphocytes were five-fold higher in Bangkok school children than rural school children. Benzene exposure in Bangkok school children was approximately two-fold higher than in rural school children. This is in agreement with the levels of biomarkers of internal benzene dose, i.e. blood benzene and urinary t,t-muconic acid. The potential health risks from exposure to genotoxic substances were assessed through DNA-damage levels and DNA repair capacity. DNA strand breaks were significantly higher, whereas DNA repair capacity was significantly reduced in Bangkok children. Genetic polymorphisms have been detected in glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes involved in the metabolism of benzene and PAHs, but these polymorphisms had no significant effects on the biomarkers of PAH exposure. Our results indicate that children living in a mega city such as Bangkok may have an increased health risk of the development of certain diseases due to exposure to genotoxic substances in air pollution compared to children living in suburban/rural areas.},

This study focuses on characterizing carbonaceous aerosols in an urban area of Bangkok, Thailand. The Microclimate and Air Pollutants Monitoring tower is located on the edge of Kasetsart University campus and was used to perform vertical measurements. Mass concentration data were collected using area dust monitors (ADR1500) at different levels above the ground (30 m, 75 m, and 110 m) during two time periods, daytime (08:00–19:00) and nighttime (20:00–07:00), throughout the monsoon season in 2015. All relevant micrometeorological parameters were simultaneously monitored. Backward air mass trajectories were calculated using HYSPLIT to assess the possible external pollution contributions. The thermal optical transmittance (TOT) method following the NIOSH 870 protocol was used to determine amounts of elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) in samples. A data analysis showed average PM2.5 values at observation heights of 30 m, 75 m, and 110 m of 6.21 ± 2.45, 8.12 ± 3.65, and 9.03 ± 3.93 µg m–3, respectively; corresponding OC concentrations of 4.13 ± 2.65, 4.01 ± 4.07, and 4.11 ± 3.58 µg m–3, respectively, and EC concentrations of 1.02 ± 0.84, 1.07 ± 0.95, and 0.50 ± 0.70 µg m–3, respectively. The results show distinct gradients of increasing concentrations of PM2.5 with increasing elevation in contract with the OC and EC concentrations which decrease with height.},

Few studies have been conducted in less-developed countries in regions with a tropical climate. This study evaluated whether short-term exposures to fine particulate matter (PM10) and ozone (O3) were associated with hospital visits for cardiovascular diseases (CVD; ICD-10th, I00–I99) in central Bangkok, Thailand.Methods: Data from hospital records were obtained from 3 major government hospitals. All hospital visits were stratified by age group and category of CVD. Daily PM10 and O3 levels reported by the Pollution Control Department from April 2002 to December 2006 (1736 days) were used in a time-series analysis with a generalized additive model procedure.Results: Exposure on the previous day to PM10 and O3 had a positive association with hospital visits for CVD among elderly (≥65 years) individuals. The increase in CVD hospital visits in this age group was 0.10\% (95\% CI, 0.03–0.19) with a 10 µg/m3 increase in PM10, and 0.50\% (95\% CI, 0.19–0.81) with an increase in O3.Conclusions: In central Bangkok, a short-term association was observed between increases in daily levels of PM10 and O3 and the number of daily emergency hospital visits for CVD, particularly among individuals aged ≥65 years.},

	abstract = {Idealized models or emulators of volcanic aerosol forcing have been widely used to reconstruct the spatiotemporal evolution of past volcanic forcing. However, existing models, including the most recently developed Easy Volcanic Aerosol (EVA; Toohey et al., doi: 10.5194/gmd-2016-83), (i) do not account for the height of injection of volcanic SO ; (ii) prescribe a vertical structure for the forcing; and (iii) are often calibrated against a single eruption. We present a new idealized model, EVA\_H, that addresses these limitations. Compared to EVA, EVA\_H makes predictions of the global mean stratospheric aerosol optical depth that are (i) similar for the 1979–1998 period characterized by the large and high-altitude tropical SO injections of El Chichón (1982) and Mount Pinatubo (1991); (ii) significantly improved for the 1998–2015 period characterized by smaller eruptions with a large variety of injection latitudes and heights. Compared to EVA, the sensitivity of volcanic forcing to injection latitude and height in EVA\_H is much more consistent with results from climate models that include interactive aerosol chemistry and microphysics, even though EVA\_H remains less sensitive to eruption latitude than the latter models. We apply EVA\_H to investigate potential biases and uncertainties in EVA-based volcanic forcing data sets from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). EVA and EVA\_H forcing reconstructions do not significantly differ for tropical high-altitude volcanic injections. However, for high-latitude or low-altitude injections, our reconstructed forcing is significantly lower. This suggests that volcanic forcing in CMIP6 last millenium experiments may be overestimated for such eruptions.},

In addition, an evaluation of a pair of CESM2 long preindustrial control and historical ensemble simulations is presented. These simulations were performed using the nominal 1° horizontal resolution configuration of the coupled model with both the “low-top” (40 km, with limited chemistry) and “high-top” (130 km, with comprehensive chemistry) versions of the atmospheric component. CESM2 contains many substantial science and infrastructure improvements and new capabilities since its previous major release, CESM1, resulting in improved historical simulations in comparison to CESM1 and available observations. These include major reductions in low-latitude precipitation and shortwave cloud forcing biases; better representation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation; better El Niño-Southern Oscillation-related teleconnections; and a global land carbon accumulation trend that agrees well with observationally based estimates. Most tropospheric and surface features of the low- and high-top simulations are very similar to each other, so these improvements are present in both configurations. CESM2 has an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 5.1–5.3 °C, larger than in CESM1, primarily due to a combination of relatively small changes to cloud microphysics and boundary layer parameters. In contrast, CESM2's transient climate response of 1.9–2.0 °C is comparable to that of CESM1. The model outputs from these and many other simulations are available to the research community, and they represent CESM2's contributions to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6.},

The aerosol eventually migrates to higher latitudes and descends across isentropic surfaces to the lower stratosphere. The aerosol is removed from the stratosphere primarily at mid- and high latitudes through various processes, mainly by isentropic transport across the tropopause from the stratosphere into the troposphere.},

	abstract = {During the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull, improvements were made to the modeling procedure at the Met Office, UK, enabling peak ash concentrations within the volcanic cloud to be estimated. In this paper we describe the ash concentration forecasting method, its rationale and how it evolved over time in response to new information and user requirements. The change from solely forecasting regions of ash to also estimating peak ash concentrations required consideration of volcanic ash emission rates, the fraction of ash surviving near-source fall-out, and the relationship between predicted mean and local peak ash concentrations unresolved by the model. To validate the modeling procedure, predicted peak ash concentrations are compared against observations obtained by ground-based and research aircraft instrumentation. This comparison between modeled and observed peak concentrations highlights the many sources of error and the uncertainties involved. Despite the challenges of predicting ash concentrations, the ash forecasting method employed here is found to give useful guidance on likely ash concentrations. Predicted peak ash concentrations lie within about one and a half orders of magnitude of the observed peak concentrations. A significant improvement in the agreement between modeled and observed values is seen if a buffer zone, accounting for positional errors in the predicted ash cloud, is used. Sensitivity of the predicted ash concentrations to the source properties (e.g., the plume height and the vertical distribution of ash at the source) is assessed and in some cases, seemingly minor uncertainties in the source specification have a large effect on predicted ash concentrations.},

Volcanic eruptions are a significant source of atmospheric SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ and its effects and lifetime depend on the SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ injection altitude. The Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) on the METOP satellite can be used to study volcanic emission of SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ using high-spectral resolution measurements from 1000 to 1200 and from 1300 to 1410 cm$^{\textrm{−1}}$ (the 7.3 and 8.7 µm SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ bands) returning both SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ amount and altitude data. The scheme described in Carboni et al. (2012) has been applied to measure volcanic SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ amount and altitude for 14 explosive eruptions from 2008 to 2012. The work includes a comparison with the following independent measurements: (i) the SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ column amounts from the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull plumes have been compared with Brewer ground measurements over Europe; (ii) the SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ plumes heights, for the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull and 2011 Grimsvötn eruptions, have been compared with CALIPSO backscatter profiles. The results of the comparisons show that IASI SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ measurements are not affected by underlying cloud and are consistent (within the retrieved errors) with the other measurements. The series of analysed eruptions (2008 to 2012) show that the biggest emitter of volcanic SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ was Nabro, followed by Kasatochi and Grímsvötn. Our observations also show a tendency for volcanic SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ to reach the level of the tropopause during many of the moderately explosive eruptions observed. For the eruptions observed, this tendency was independent of the maximum amount of SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ (e.g. 0.2 Tg for Dalafilla compared with 1.6 Tg for Nabro) and of the volcanic explosive index (between 3 and 5).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Following the disruption to European airspace caused by the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull in 2010 there has been a move towards producing quantitative predictions of volcanic ash concentration using volcanic ash transport and dispersion simulators. However, there is no formal framework for determining the uncertainties of these predictions and performing many simulations using these complex models is computationally expensive. In this paper a Bayesian linear emulation approach is applied to the Numerical Atmospheric-dispersion Modelling Environment (NAME) to better understand the influence of source and internal model parameters on the simulator output. Emulation is a statistical method for predicting the output of a computer simulator at new parameter choices without actually running the simulator. A multi-level emulation approach is applied using two configurations of NAME with different numbers of model particles. Information from many evaluations of the computationally faster configuration is combined with results from relatively few evaluations of the slower, more accurate, configuration. This approach is effective when it is not possible to run the accurate simulator many times and when there is also little prior knowledge about the influence of parameters. The approach is applied to the mean ash column loading in 75 geographical regions on 14 May 2010. Through this analysis it has been found that the parameters that contribute the most to the output uncertainty are initial plume rise height, mass eruption rate, free tropospheric turbulence levels and precipitation threshold for wet deposition. This information can be used to inform future model development and observational campaigns and routine monitoring. The analysis presented here suggests the need for further observational and theoretical research into parameterisation of atmospheric turbulence. Furthermore it can also be used to inform the most important parameter perturbations for a small operational ensemble of simulations. The use of an emulator also identifies the input and internal parameters that do not contribute significantly to simulator uncertainty. Finally, the analysis highlights that the faster, less accurate, configuration of NAME can, on its own, provide useful information for the problem of predicting average column load over large areas.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Tephra transport models try to predict atmospheric dispersion and sedimentation of tephra depending on meteorology, particle properties, and eruption characteristics, defined by eruption column height, mass eruption rate, and vertical distribution of mass. Models are used for different purposes, from operational forecast of volcanic ash clouds to hazard assessment of tephra dispersion and fallout. The size of the erupted particles, a key parameter controlling the dynamics of particle sedimentation in the atmosphere, varies within a wide range. Largest centimetric to millimetric particles fallout at proximal to medial distances from the volcano and sediment by gravitational settling. On the other extreme, smallest micrometric to sub-micrometric particles can be transported at continental or even at global scales and are affected by other deposition and aggregation mechanisms. Different scientific communities had traditionally modeled the dispersion of these two end members. Volcanologists developed families of models suitable for lapilli and coarse ash and aimed at computing fallout deposits and for hazard assessment. In contrast, meteorologists and atmospheric scientists have traditionally used other atmospheric transport models, dealing with finer particles, for tracking motion of volcanic ash clouds and, eventually, for computing airborne ash concentrations. During the last decade, the increasing demand for model accuracy and forecast reliability has pushed on two fronts. First, the original gap between these different families of models has been filled with the emergence of multi-scale and multi-purpose models. Second, new modeling strategies including, for example, ensemble and probabilistic forecast or model data assimilation are being investigated for future implementation in models and or modeling strategies. This paper reviews the evolution of tephra transport and dispersal models during the last two decades, presents the status and limitations of the current modeling strategies, and discusses some emergent perspectives expected to be implemented at operational level during the next few years. Improvements in both real-time forecasting and long-term hazard assessment are necessary to loss prevention programs on a local, regional, national and international level.},

	abstract = {The injection of sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the stratosphere to form an artiﬁcial stratospheric aerosol layer is discussed as an option for solar radiation management. Sulfate aerosol scatters solar radiation and absorbs infrared radiation, which warms the stratospheric sulfur layer. Simulations with the general circulation model ECHAM5-HAM, including aerosol microphysics, show consequences of this warming, including changes of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in the tropics. The QBO slows down after an injection of 4 Tg(S) yr−1 and completely shuts down after an injection of 8 Tg(S) yr−1. Transport of species in the tropics and subtropics depends on the phase of the QBO. Consequently, the heated aerosol layer not only impacts the oscillation of the QBO but also the meridional transport of the sulfate aerosols. The stronger the injection, the stronger the heating and the simulated impact on the QBO and equatorial wind systems. With increasing injection rate the velocity of the equatorial jet streams increases, and the less sulfate is transported out of the tropics. This reduces the global distribution of sulfate and decreases the radiative forcing efﬁciency of the aerosol layer by 10 to 14 \% compared to simulations with low vertical resolution and without generated QBO. Increasing the height of the injection increases the radiative forcing only for injection rates below 10 Tg(S) yr−1 (8–18 \%), a much smaller value than the 50 \% calculated previously. Stronger injection rates at higher levels even result in smaller forcing than the injections at lower levels.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} An analytical inversion method has been developed to estimate the vertical profile of SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ emissions from volcanic eruptions. The method uses satellite-observed total SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ columns and an atmospheric transport model (FLEXPART) to exploit the fact that winds change with altitude – thus, the position and shape of the volcanic plume bear information on its emission altitude. The method finds the vertical emission distribution which minimizes the total difference between simulated and observed SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ columns while also considering a priori information. We have tested the method with the eruption of Jebel at Tair, Yemen, on 30 September 2007 for which a comprehensive observational data set from various satellite instruments (AIRS, OMI, SEVIRI, CALIPSO) is available. Using satellite data from the first 24 h after the eruption for the inversion, we found an emission maximum near 16 km above sea level (a.s.l.), and secondary maxima near 5, 9, 12 and 14 km a.s.l. 60\% of the emission occurred above the tropopause. The emission profile obtained in the inversion was then used to simulate the transport of the plume over the following week. The modeled plume agrees very well with SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ total columns observed by OMI, and its altitude agrees with CALIPSO aerosol observations to within 1–2 km. The inversion result is robust against various changes in both the a priori and the observations. Even when using only SEVIRI data from the first 15 h after the eruption, the emission profile was reasonably well estimated. The method is computationally very fast. It is therefore suitable for implementation within an operational environment, such as the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers, to predict the threat posed by volcanic ash for air traffic. It could also be helpful for assessing the sulfur input into the stratosphere, be it in the context of volcanic processes or also for proposed geo-engineering techniques to counteract global warming.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {We provide a comprehensive description of the high-resolution version of the TM5-MP global chemistry transport model, which is to be employed for deriving highly resolved vertical profiles of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), formaldehyde (CH2O), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) for use in satellite retrievals from platforms such as the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Sentinel-5 Precursor, and the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (tropOMI). Comparing simulations conducted at horizontal resolutions of 3° × 2° and 1° × 1° reveals differences of ±20\% exist in the global seasonal distribution of 222Rn, being larger near specific coastal locations and tropical oceans. For tropospheric ozone (O3), analysis of the chemical budget terms shows that the impact on globally integrated photolysis rates is rather low, in spite of the higher spatial variability of meteorological data fields from ERA-Interim at 1° × 1°. Surface concentrations of O3 in high-NOx regions decrease between 5 and 10 \% at 1° × 1° due to a reduction in NOx recycling terms and an increase in the associated titration term of O3 by NO. At 1° × 1°, the net global stratosphere-troposphere exchange of O3 decreases by ∼7\%, with an associated shift in the hemispheric gradient. By comparing NO, NO2, HNO3 and peroxy-acetyl-nitrate (PAN) profiles against measurement composites, we show that TM5-MP captures the vertical distribution of NOx and long-lived NOx reservoirs at background locations, again with modest changes at 1° × 1°. Comparing monthly mean distributions in lightning NOx and applying ERA-Interim convective mass fluxes, we show that the vertical re-distribution of lightning NOx changes with enhanced release of NOx in the upper troposphere. We show that surface mixing ratios in both NO and NO2 are generally underestimated in both low-and high-NOx scenarios. For Europe, a negative bias exists for [NO] at the surface across the whole domain, with lower biases at 1° × 1° at only ∼20\% of sites. For NO2, biases are more variable, with lower (higher) biases at 1° × 1° occurring at ∼35\% (∼20\%) of sites, with the remainder showing little change. For CH2O, the impact of higher resolution on the chemical budget terms is rather modest, with changes of less than 5\%. The simulated vertical distribution of CH2O agrees reasonably well with measurements in pristine locations, although column-integrated values are generally underestimated relative to satellite measurements in polluted regions. For SO2, the performance at 1° × 1° is principally governed by the quality of the emission inventory, with limited improvements in the site-specific biases, with most showing no significant improvement. For the vertical column, improvements near strong source regions occur which reduce the biases in the integrated column. For remote regions missing biogenic source terms are inferred. © 2017 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is an important atmospheric constituent that plays a crucial role in many atmospheric processes. Volcanic eruptions are a significant source of atmospheric SO2 and its effects and lifetime depend on the SO2 injection altitude. The Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) on the METOP satellite can be used to study volcanic emission of SO2 using high-spectral resolution measurements from 1000 to 1200 and from 1300 to 1410ĝ€cmĝ'1 (the 7.3 and 8.7ĝ€μm SO2 bands) returning both SO2 amount and altitude data. The scheme described in Carboni et al. (2012) has been applied to measure volcanic SO2 amount and altitude for 14 explosive eruptions from 2008 to 2012. The work includes a comparison with the following independent measurements: (i) the SO2 column amounts from the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull plumes have been compared with Brewer ground measurements over Europe; (ii) the SO2 plumes heights, for the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull and 2011 Grimsvötn eruptions, have been compared with CALIPSO backscatter profiles. The results of the comparisons show that IASI SO2 measurements are not affected by underlying cloud and are consistent (within the retrieved errors) with the other measurements. The series of analysed eruptions (2008 to 2012) show that the biggest emitter of volcanic SO2 was Nabro, followed by Kasatochi and Grímsvötn. Our observations also show a tendency for volcanic SO2 to reach the level of the tropopause during many of the moderately explosive eruptions observed. For the eruptions observed, this tendency was independent of the maximum amount of SO2 (e.g. 0.2ĝ€Tg for Dalafilla compared with 1.6ĝ€Tg for Nabro) and of the volcanic explosive index (between 3 and 5). © Author(s) 2016.},

	abstract = {Introduction Long-term air pollution exposure contributes to mortality but there are few studies examining effects of very long-term ({\textgreater}25 years) exposures.
Methods This study investigated modelled air pollution concentrations at residence for 1971, 1981, 1991 (black smoke (BS) and SO2) and 2001 (PM10) in relation to mortality up to 2009 in 367 658 members of the longitudinal survey, a 1\% sample of the English Census. Outcomes were all-cause (excluding accidents), cardiovascular (CV) and respiratory mortality.
Results BS and SO2 exposures remained associated with mortality decades after exposure—BS exposure in 1971 was signiﬁcantly associated with all-cause (OR 1.02 (95\% CI 1.01 to 1.04)) and respiratory (OR 1.05 (95\% CI 1.01 to 1.09)) mortality in 2002–2009 (ORs expressed per 10 μg/m3). Largest effect sizes were seen for more recent exposures and for respiratory disease. PM10 exposure in 2001 was associated with all outcomes in 2002–2009 with stronger associations for respiratory (OR 1.22 (95\% CI 1.04 to 1.44)) than CV mortality (OR 1.12 (95\% CI 1.01 to 1.25)). Adjusting PM10 for past BS and SO2 exposures in 1971, 1981 and 1991 reduced the all-cause OR to 1.16 (95\% CI 1.07 to 1.26) while CV and respiratory associations lost signiﬁcance, suggesting confounding by past air pollution exposure, but there was no evidence for effect modiﬁcation. Limitations include limited information on confounding by smoking and exposure misclassiﬁcation of historic exposures.
Conclusions This large national study suggests that air pollution exposure has long-term effects on mortality that persist decades after exposure, and that historic air pollution exposures inﬂuence current estimates of associations between air pollution and mortality.},

	abstract = {The eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano, Iceland, in April and May 2010 caused unprecedented disruptions of European air traffic showing that timely monitoring of volcanic ash and SO2 dispersion as well as the corresponding plume heights are important for aviation safety. This paper describes the observations of SO2 and BrO columns in the eruption plume and the determination of the SO2 plume height using the GOME-2 satellite instrument. During the eruptive period in May 2010, SO2 total columns of up to ∼20 DU and BrO columns of ∼7.7 × 1013 molec/cm2 were detected. The BrO/SO2 ratio estimated from the GOME-2 observations of the Eyjafjallajökull eruption varies from 1.1 × 10−4 to 2.1 × 10−4. The SO2 plume heights estimated from the GOME-2 observations on 5 May range from 8–13 km and mostly agree within 1–3 km with visual observations, radar data and modeling results. Furthermore, the GOME-2 SO2 observations are compared with in situ measurements of the DLR Falcon aircraft on 17 and 18 May 2010 and with Brewer instruments at Valentia, Ireland and Hohenpeissenberg, Germany. The SO2 columns derived from the Falcon profile measurements range from 0.6–4.7 DU and the comparison with the GOME-2 measurements shows a good agreement, mainly within 1 DU. The Brewer observations at Hohenpeissenberg also agree well with the GOME-2 measurements with a daily average SO2 column of ∼1.3 DU during the overpass of the SO2 cloud on 18 May, whereas the Brewer instrument at Valentia shows up to 50\% higher SO2 columns (∼8 DU) on 11 May.},

	abstract = {We use the GEOS-5 general circulation model to simulate the transport of the volcanic cloud from an eruption similar to the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. The simulated aerosol optical thickness and transport of the volcanic cloud are in good agreement with observations of the actual Pinatubo eruption from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II (SAGE II) and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and with vertical profiles of sulfur dioxide observed by the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). We tested the importance of initial conditions corresponding to the specific meteorological situation at the time of the eruption by comparing results when GEOS-5 is initialized using Modern Era Retrospective Analyses for Research and Applications (MERRA) reanalysis fields with results when it is initialized from an existing model run. We found no significant difference in the transport of the cloud. We show how the inclusion of the interaction between volcanic sulfate aerosol and radiation is essential for a reliable simulation of the transport of the volcanic cloud. The absorption of longwave radiation by the volcanic sulfate largely induces the rising of the volcanic cloud up to the middle stratosphere and the divergent motion from the latitude of the eruption to the tropics. Our simulations indicate that the cloud is transported to the Northern Hemisphere through a lower stratospheric pathway and to middle and high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere through a middle stratospheric pathway, centered at about 30 hPa. The direction of the middle stratospheric pathway depends on the season of the eruption.},

This paper investigates the reliability of using SO2 as a proxy for the location of volcanic ash, using an SO2 retrieval from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) and ash detections from IASI and the Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR). Using a numerical “missed ash fraction” applied to the eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull in 2010 and Puyehue-Cordón Caulle in 2011 reveals that the SO2 flag typically misses ∼30\% of the detectable ash. Furthermore, the missed ash fraction is found to be highly variable, both between the two eruptions and over the course of each eruption, with values of over 80\% found on some days. The detection threshold of the AATSR ash flag is also investigated using radiative transfer calculations, allowing the threshold of the IASI flag to be inferred, and these are related to the ash contamination levels.},

We carry out quantitative studies of these mechanisms to determine if they can account for some of the observed properties of the aerosol. We show that the altitude range in which nucleation of H$_{\textrm{2}}$SO$_{\textrm{4}}$-H$_{\textrm{2}}$O solution droplets can take place corresponds to that region of the stratosphere where the aerosol is generally found. Since heterogeneous nucleation is the dominant nucleation mechanism, the stratospheric solution droplets are mainly formed on particles which have been mixed up from the troposphere or injected into the stratosphere by volcanoes or meteorites. Particle growth by heteromolecular condensation can account for the observed increase in mixing ratio of large particles in the stratosphere. Coagulation is important in reducing the number of particles smaller than 0.05 µm radius. Growth by condensation, applied to the mixed nature of the particles, shows that available information is consistent with ammonium sulfate being formed by liquid phase chemical reactions in the aerosol particles. The upper altitude limit of the aerosol layer is probably due to the evaporation of sulfuric acid aerosol particles, while the lower limit is due to mixing across the tropopause.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The explosive eruptions of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991 injected enormous clouds of volcanic ash and acid gases into the stratosphere to altitudes in excess of 100,000 feet. The largest ash cloud, from the June 15 eruption, was carried by upper level winds to the west and circled the globe in 22 days. The June 15 cloud spread laterally to cover a broad equatorial band from about 10°S. to 20° N. latitude and contaminated some of the world's busiest air traffic corridors. Sixteen damaging encounters were reported between jet aircraft and the drifting ash clouds from the June 12 and 15, 1991, eruptions. Three encounters occurred within 200 kilometers from the volcano with ash clouds less than 3 hours old. Twelve encounters occurred over Southeast Asia at distances of 720 to 1,740 kilometers west from the volcano when the ash cloud was between 12 and 24 hours old. Encounters with the Pinatubo ash cloud caused in-flight loss of power to one engine on each of two different aircraft. A total of 10 engines were damaged and replaced, including all four engines on a single jumbo jet. Following the 1991 eruptions, longer term damage to aircraft and engines related to volcanogenic SO2 gas has been documented including crazing of acrylic airplane windows, premature fading of polyurethane paint on jetliners, and accumulation of sulfate deposits in engines.},

Here we report the detection, using a satellite-borne infrared sensor, of ≳ 2 million tonnes of ice in the cloud produced by the September 1994 eruption of Rabaul volcano, in Papua New Guinea. The cloud also contained relatively low levels of sulphur dioxide (80 ± 50 kilotonnes), compared with other stratospheric eruption clouds. The unusual aspects of this cloud may be related to the entry of sea water into the volcanic vent, and its participation in the eruption column. Past eruptions that occurred in similar (coastal) settings, such as those of Krakatau and Santorini, might have had less effect on the atmosphere than their volume alone would suggest, because the presence of ice may decrease the residence time of ash and sulphur in the atmosphere. In addition, the ability of ice to mask the characteristic spectral signature of volcanic ash will increase the difficulty of designing airborne ash detection systems for aviation safety.},

Other risks include the possibility of abrasion of windshields and potentially serious damage to avionic systems. These hazards have been widely recognized since the early 1980s, when volcanic ash provoked several incidents of engine failure in commercial aircraft. In addition to volcanic ash, volcanic gases also pose a threat. Prolonged and/or cumulative exposure to sulphur dioxide (SO$_{\textrm{2}}$) or sulphuric acid (H$_{\textrm{2}}$SO$_{\textrm{4}}$) aerosols potentially affects e.g. windows, air frame and may cause permanent damage to engines. SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ receives most attention among the gas species commonly found in volcanic plumes because its presence above the lower troposphere is a clear proxy for a volcanic cloud and indicates that fine ash could also be present. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Up to now, remote sensing of SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ via Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) in the ultraviolet spectral region has been used to measure volcanic clouds from ground based, airborne and satellite platforms. Attention has been given to volcanic emission strength, chemistry inside volcanic clouds and measurement procedures were adapted accordingly. Here we present a set of experimental and model results, highlighting the feasibility of DOAS to be used as an airborne early detection system of SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ in two spatial dimensions. In order to prove our new concept, simultaneous airborne and ground-based measurements of the plume of Popocatépetl volcano, Mexico, were conducted in April 2010. The plume extended at an altitude around 5250 m above sea level and was approached and traversed at the same altitude with several forward looking DOAS systems aboard an airplane. These DOAS systems measured SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ in the flight direction and at \&pm;40 mrad (2.3\&deg;) angles relative to it in both, horizontal and vertical directions. The approaches started at up to 25 km distance to the plume and SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ was measured at all times well above the detection limit. In combination with radiative transfer studies, this study indicates that an extended volcanic cloud with a concentration of 10$^{\textrm{12}}$ molecules cm$^{\textrm{\&minus;3}}$ at typical flight levels of 10 km can be detected unambiguously at distances of up to 80 km away. This range provides enough time (approx. 5 min) for pilots to take action to avoid entering a volcanic cloud in the flight path, suggesting that this technique can be used as an effective aid to prevent dangerous aircraft encounters with potentially ash rich volcanic clouds.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {This present work investigates several local and synoptic meteorological aspects associated with two wintertime haze episodes in Greater Bangkok using observational data, covering synoptic patterns evolution, day-to-day and diurnal variation, dynamic stability, temperature inversion, and back-trajectories. The episodes include an elevated haze event of 16 days (14\&ndash;29 January 2015) for the first episode and 8 days (19\&ndash;26 December 2017) for the second episode, together with some days before and after the haze event. Daily PM2.5 was found to be 50 \&micro;g m\&minus;3 or higher over most of the days during both haze events. These haze events commonly have cold surges as the background synoptic feature to initiate or trigger haze evolution. A cold surge reached the study area before the start of each haze event, causing temperature and relative humidity to drop abruptly initially but then gradually increased as the cold surge weakened or dissipated. Wind speed was relatively high when the cold surge was active. Global radiation was generally modulated by cloud cover, which turns relatively high during each haze event because cold surge induces less cloud. Daytime dynamic stability was generally unstable along the course of each haze event, except being stable at the ending of the second haze event due to a tropical depression. In each haze event, low-level temperature inversion existed, with multiple layers seen in the beginning, effectively suppressing atmospheric dilution. Large-scale subsidence inversion aloft was also persistently present. In both episodes, PM2.5 showed stronger diurnality during the time of elevated haze, as compared to the pre- and post-haze periods. During the first episode, an apparent contrast of PM2.5 diurnality was seen between the first and second parts of the haze event with relatively low afternoon PM2.5 over its first part, but relatively high afternoon PM2.5 over its second part, possibly due to the role of secondary aerosols. PM2.5/PM10 ratio was relatively lower in the first episode because of more impact of biomass burning, which was in general agreement with back-trajectories and active fire hotspots. The second haze event, with little biomass burning in the region, was likely to be caused mainly by local anthropogenic emissions. These findings suggest a need for haze-related policymaking with an integrated approach that accounts for all important emission sectors for both particulate and gaseous precursors of secondary aerosols. Given that cold surges induce an abrupt change in local meteorology, the time window to apply control measures for haze is limited, emphasizing the need for readiness in mitigation responses and early public warning.},

	abstract = {Modeling the transport of volcanic ash and gases released during volcanic eruptions is crucially dependent on knowledge of the source term of the eruption, that is, the source strength as a function of altitude and time. For the first time, an inversion method is used to estimate the source terms of both volcanic sulfur dioxide (SO2) and ash. It was applied to the explosive volcanic eruption of Grímsvötn, Iceland, in May 2011. The method uses input from the particle dispersion model, FLEXPART (flexible particle dispersion model), a priori source estimates, and satellite observations of SO2 or ash total columns from Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer to separately obtain the source terms for volcanic SO2 and fine ash. The estimated source terms show that SO2 was emitted mostly to high altitudes (5 to 13 km) during about 18 h (22 May, 00–18 UTC) while fine ash was emitted mostly to low altitudes (below 4 km) during roughly 24 h (22 May 06 UTC to 23 May 06 UTC). FLEXPART simulations using the estimated source terms show a clear separation of SO2 (transported mostly northwestward) and the fine ash (transported mostly southeastward). This corresponds well with independent satellite observations and measured aerosol mass concentrations and lidar measurements at surface stations in Scandinavia. Aircraft measurements above Iceland and Germany confirmed that the ash was located in the lower atmosphere. This demonstrates that the inversion method, in this case, is able to distinguish between emission heights of SO2 and ash and can capture resulting differences in transport patterns.},

The aim of this review is to systematically evaluate the relationship between air pollution and risk of wheeze-associated disorders in children in Southeast Asia. We searched the relevant computerized databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane library) for indexed publications up to July 2018. Finally, eight studies were qualified for performing a random-effect meta-analysis to compute the pooled effect sizes. The results show that each increase of 10 μg/m$^{\textrm{3}}$ in concentrations of PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$, PM$_{\textrm{1}}$ was associated with 1–2\% increase in risk of wheeze-associated disorders. Positive associations were found for PM$_{\textrm{10}}$, SO$_{\textrm{2}}$, NO$_{\textrm{2}}$, NO$_{\textrm{x}}$ but no association was found for CO and O$_{\textrm{3}}$. We confirmed the strong effect of fine particulate matters on respiratory health and recommend an updated meta-analysis should be done when more studies are available.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

Explosive volcanic eruptions are capricious in nature and are able to eject millions of tonnes of hazardous particles and gases into the atmosphere in a matter of hours. As eruptions can occur with little or no warning and often in remote locations, both timely and global observations are required. Earth-observing satellites are well suited to this task. Since the late 1970s, volcanic clouds composed mainly of SO2 and silicate particles (ash) have been observed and researched through the analysis of remotely sensed data. A short history and qualitative description of common retrieval methods applied to satellite measurements of ash and SO2 are presented. The associated impacts of volcanic eruptions on the global aviation industry and radiative effects on climate are reviewed and discussed in the context of satellite remote sensing.},

This paper explores the relationship between local vehicle emissions and the winter haze in Beijing before and during the COVID-19 lockdown based on an integrated analysis framework, which combines a real-time on-road emission inventory, in situ air quality observations, and a localized numerical modeling system. We found that traffic emissions decreased substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic, but its imbalanced emission abatement of NOx (76\%, 125.3 Mg/day) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs, 53\%, 52.9 Mg/day) led to a significant rise of atmospheric oxidants in urban areas, resulting in a modest increase in secondary aerosols due to inadequate precursors, which still offset reduced primary emissions. Moreover, the enhanced oxidizing capacity in the surrounding regions greatly increased the secondary particles with relatively abundant precursors, which was transported into Beijing and mainly responsible for the aggravated haze pollution. We recommend that mitigation policies should focus on accelerating VOC emission reduction and synchronously controlling regional sources to release the benefits of local traffic emission control.},

This paper aims to investigate the climatologic and gaseous factors influencing the occurrence of PM10 concentration using Pollution Control Department (PCD) data. The secondary data of 2009 to 2017 obtained from the PCD was used for analysis. We used descriptive statistics, Pearson’s correlation coefficient, multiple regression and graphic presentation using R program (R packages of ‘open air’ and ‘ncdf4’) and Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet®. In addition, the periodic measurement of PM2.5 and PM10 were investigated to determine the ratio of PM2.5/PM10. The results indicated that haze episodes (daily PM10 concentration always over the PCD standard) normally occur during the dry season from February to April. The maximum concentration was always found in March. The PM10 concentration was negatively associated with relative humidity and temperature while the PM10 concentration showed a strongly positive association with CO and NO2 concentration with correlation values of 0.70 and 0.57, respectively. Furthermore, we found CO and PM10 concentration was associated with ozone concentration. This finding will benefit local communities and the public health sector to provide a warning system for preparation and response plans to react to PM10 episodes in their responsible areas.},

Ash-rich particles dominate the volcanic cloud optical properties for the first 60 days. We also find that the initial SO2 lifetime is determined by SO2 uptake on ash, rather than by reaction with OH as commonly assumed. About 43\% more volcanic sulfur is removed from the stratosphere in 2 months with the SO2 heterogeneous chemistry on ash particles than without. This research suggests the need for re-evaluation of factors controlling SO2 lifetime in climate model simulations, and of the impact of volcanic ash on stratospheric chemistry and radiation.},

The present work focuses on quantifying magnitudes and timescales of deposition effects in aircraft engines and the adaptation of the generalized Kern and Seaton deposition model for application in axial compressor blade rows. The test rig's cascade was designed to be representative of aircraft engine compressor blading. The cascade was exposed to an accelerated deposition process. Reproducible deposition patterns were identified. Results showed an asymptotic progression of blade row performance deterioration. A significant increase in total pressure loss and decrease in static pressure rise were measured. Application of the validated model using existing particle concentration and flight cycle data showed that more than 95\% of the performance deterioration due to deposition occurs within the first 1000 flight cycles.},

During the course of the eruption, monitoring was done by both instruments and direct observations, together providing unique insight into the current activity of Hekla. During the 12-day eruption, a total of 0.189 km3 DRE of magma was emitted. The eruptive fissure split into five segments. The segments at the highest altitude were active during the first hours, while the segments at lower altitude continued  throughout the eruption. The eruption started in a highly explosive manner giving rise to a Subplinian eruptive column and consequent basaltic pyroclastic flows fed by column collapses. After the explosive phase reached its maximum, the eruption went through three more phases, namely fire-fountaining, Strombolian  bursts and lava effusion. In this paper, we describe the course of events of the eruption of Hekla and the origin of its magma, and then show that the discharge rate can be linked to different style of eruptive activity, which are controlled by fissure geometry. We also show that the eruption phases observed at Hekla can be linked with inferred magma chamber overpressure prior to the eruption.},

	abstract = {Aerosol emissions from volcanic eruptions in otherwise clean environments are regarded as “natural experiments” where the aerosol effects on clouds and climate can be partitioned from other effects like meteorology and anthropogenic emissions. In this work, we combined satellite retrievals, reanalysis products, and atmospheric modeling to analyze the mechanism of 5 aerosol-cloud interactions during two degassing events at the Kilauea Volcano in 2008 and 2018. The eruptive nature of the 2008 and 2018 degassing events was distinct from long-term volcanic activity for Kilauea. For both events, we performed a comprehensive investigation on the effects of aerosol emissions on macro and microphysical cloud processes for both liquid and ice clouds. This is the ﬁrst time such an analysis has been reported for the 2018 event. Similarities between both events suggested that aerosol-cloud interactions related to the cloud albedo modiﬁcation were likely decoupled from local meteorology. 10 In both events the ingestion of aerosols within convective parcels enhanced the detrainment of condensate in the upper troposphere resulting in deeper clouds than in pristine conditions. Accounting for ice nucleation on ash particles led to enhanced ice crystal concentrations at cirrus levels and a slight decrease in ice water content, improving the correlation of the model results with the satellite retrievals. Overall, aerosol loading, plume characteristics, and meteorology contributed to observed and simulated changes in clouds during the Kilauea degassing events.},

	abstract = {Observations and models have shown that continuously degassing volcanoes have a potentially large effect on the natural background aerosol loading and the radiative state of the atmosphere. We use a global aerosol microphysics model to quantify the impact of these volcanic emissions on the cloud albedo radiative forcing under pre-industrial (PI) and present-day (PD) conditions. We ﬁnd that volcanic degassing increases global annual mean cloud droplet number concentrations by 40 \% under PI conditions, but by only 10 \% under PD conditions. Consequently, volcanic degassing causes a global annual mean cloud albedo effect of −1.06 W m−2 in the PI era but only −0.56 W m−2 in the PD era. This non-equal effect is explained partly by the lower background aerosol concentrations in the PI era, but also because more aerosol particles are produced per unit of volcanic sulphur emission in the PI atmosphere. The higher sensitivity of the PI atmosphere to volcanic emissions has an important consequence for the anthropogenic cloud radiative forcing because the large uncertainty in volcanic emissions translates into an uncertainty in the PI baseline cloud radiative state. Assuming a −50/+100 \% uncertainty range in the volcanic sulphur ﬂux, we estimate the annual mean anthropogenic cloud albedo forcing to lie between −1.16 W m−2 and −0.86 W m−2. Therefore, the volcanically induced uncertainty in the PI baseline cloud radiative state substantially adds to the already large uncertainty in the magnitude of the indirect radiative forcing of climate.},

	abstract = {Commercial aircraft operating in some regions of the world are subject to harsh atmospheric conditions that can affect the efficiency and integrity of modern aero-engines. Conditions that are investigated in this contribution are dusty atmospheres following sand storms. Specifically, the dust ingested by the engines of an Airbus A380-841 (Rolls-Royce Trent 900) operating out of Doha airport (IATA: HIA) is estimated by simulating climb-out trajectories over three separate calendar months during which a number of sand storms have been identified. The atmosphere model incorporates dust concentration hind-casts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) near real-time Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service database. A total of 365 flights were considered. The average dust mass ingested into the engine core per flight is estimated as ∼8.5 g. Using a compressor fouling prediction model, the dust ingestion reduces the asymptotic deterioration rate time constant by a factor ∼8. The worst dust storm within the time frame considered is selected for further examination. This flight is flagged as a dust-flight, during which the total mass of dust ingested into the engine core exceeds the monthly mean by two standard deviations. A peak dust ingestion rate of 22 mg/s occurs shortly after take-off, midway through the first climb segment. A second peak presents as the aircraft transitions into the climb from 3,000 feet to 10,000 feet. Finally, the dust ingested during a 20-minute holding pattern over the Persian Gulf is estimated as ∼8 g, which is approximately the same as the dust ingested during climb-out on a very dusty day. The results suggest that a mission-based approach may be more useful for determining aircraft engine durability in dusty environments.},

	abstract = {The separation of volcanic ash and sulfur dioxide (SO2) gas is sometimes observed during volcanic eruptions. The exact conditions under which separation occurs are not fully understood but the phenomenon is of importance because of the effects volcanic emissions have on aviation, on the environment, and on the earth's radiation balance. The eruption of Grímsvötn, a subglacial volcano under the Vatnajökull glacier in Iceland during 21-28 May 2011 produced one of the most spectacular examples of ash and SO2 separation, which led to errors in the forecasting of ash in the atmosphere over northern Europe. Satellite data from several sources coupled with meteorological wind data and photographic evidence suggest that the eruption column was unable to sustain itself, resulting in a large deposition of ash, which left a low-level ash-rich atmospheric plume moving southwards and then eastwards towards the southern Scandinavian coast and a high-level predominantly SO2 plume travelling northwards and then spreading eastwards and westwards. Here we provide observational and modelling perspectives on the separation of ash and SO2 and present quantitative estimates of the masses of ash and SO2 that erupted, the directions of transport, and the likely impacts. We hypothesise that a partial column collapse or "sloughing" fed with ash from pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) occurred during the early stage of the eruption, leading to an ash-laden gravity intrusion that was swept southwards, separated from the main column. Our model suggests that water-mediated aggregation caused enhanced ash removal because of the plentiful supply of source water from melted glacial ice and from entrained atmospheric water. The analysis also suggests that ash and SO2 should be treated with separate source terms, leading to improvements in forecasting the movement of both types of emissions.},

	abstract = {Current Earth Observation (EO) satellites provide excellent spatial, temporal and spectral coverage for passive measurements of atmospheric volcanic emissions. Of particular value for ash detection and quantification are the geostationary satellites that now carry multispectral imagers. These instruments have multiple spectral channels spanning the visible to infrared (IR) wavelengths and provide 1 \&times; 1 km2 to 4 \&times; 4 km2 resolution data every 5\&ndash;15 min, continuously. For ash detection, two channels situated near 11 and 12    \&mu;   m are needed; for ash quantification a third or fourth channel also in the infrared is useful for constraining the height of the ash cloud. This work describes passive EO infrared measurements and techniques to determine volcanic cloud properties and includes examples using current methods with an emphasis on the main difficulties and ways to overcome them. A challenging aspect of using satellite data is to design algorithms that make use of the spectral, temporal (especially for geostationary sensors) and spatial information. The hyperspectral sensor AIRS is used to identify specific molecules from their spectral signatures (e.g., for SO2) and retrievals are demonstrated as global, regional and hemispheric maps of AIRS column SO2. This kind of information is not available on all sensors, but by combining temporal, spatial and broadband multi-spectral information from polar and geo sensors (e.g., MODIS and SEVIRI) useful insights can be made. For example, repeat coverage of a particular area using geostationary data can reveal temporal behaviour of broadband channels indicative of eruptive activity. In many instances, identifying the nature of a pixel (clear, cloud, ash etc.) is the major challenge. Sophisticated cloud detection schemes have been developed that utilise statistical measures, physical models and temporal variation to classify pixels. The state of the art on cloud detection is good, but improvements are always needed. An IR-based multispectral cloud identification scheme is described and some examples shown. The scheme is physically based but has deficiencies that can be improved during the daytime by including information from the visible channels. Physical retrieval schemes applied to ash detected pixels suffer from a lack of knowledge of some basic microphysical and optical parameters needed to run the retrieval models. In particular, there is a lack of accurate spectral refractive index information for ash particles. The size distribution of fine ash (1\&ndash;63    \&mu;   m, diameter) is poorly constrained and more measurements are needed, particularly for ash that is airborne. Height measurements are also lacking and a satellite-based stereoscopic height retrieval is used to illustrate the value of this information for aviation. The importance of water in volcanic clouds is discussed here and the separation of ice-rich and ash-rich portions of volcanic clouds is analysed for the first time. More work is required in trying to identify ice-coated ash particles, and it is suggested that a class of ice-rich volcanic cloud be recognized and termed a \&lsquo;volcanic ice\&rsquo; cloud. Such clouds are frequently observed in tropical eruptions of great vertical extent (e.g., 8 km or higher) and are often not identified correctly by traditional IR methods (e.g., reverse absorption). Finally, the global, hemispheric and regional sampling of EO satellites is demonstrated for a few eruptions where the ash and SO     2     dispersed over large distances (1000s km).},

There are 46 references involved in the detailed assessment, selected according to variables such as methodology, paper outcomes and industry stakeholder. This emergent aviation and climate change adaptation literature could be broadened to cover more disciplines and approaches, an increased range of aviation stakeholders and go further beyond the larger airport case studies in developed countries.

	abstract = {Abstract. In order to assist the elaboration of proactive measures for the management of future volcanic eruptions in Iceland, we developed a new scenario-based approach to assess the hazard associated with tephra dispersal and sedimentation at various scales and for multiple sources. The target volcanoes are Hekla, Katla, Eyjafjallajökull and Askja, selected either for their high probabilities of eruption and/or their high potential impact. By coupling tephrostratigraphic studies, probabilistic techniques and modelling, we developed comprehensive eruption scenarios for both short- and long-lasting eruptions and compiled hazard maps for tephra ground deposition at a national scale and air concentration at a European scale using the TEPHRA2 and FALL3D models, respectively. New algorithms for the identification of realistic sets of eruptive source parameters are investigated, which assist the generation of probability density functions of eruption source parameters for the selected scenarios. Aggregation processes were accounted for using various empirical models. Outcomes, i.e. probabilities conditioned to the occurrence of an eruption, help the assessment and comparison of hazard levels at different scales. For example, at a national scale Askja has a 5–10\% probability of blanketing the easternmost half of the country with a tephra accumulation of at least 1 kg m−2. At a continental scale, Katla has a 5–10\% probability of producing ash clouds with concentrations of 2 mg m−3 over the UK, Scandinavia and northern Europe with a mean arrival time of 48–72 h and a mean persistence time of 6–18 h. In a companion paper, Scaini et al. (2014) present a vulnerability assessment for Iceland to ground deposition of tephra and for the European air traffic to airborne ash which, combined with the outcomes of the present paper, constitute one of the first comprehensive multi-scale risk assessment associated with tephra dispersal and sedimentation.},

For sAOD, three integration methods were developed to maximize the inﬂuence of AERONET data and ensure consistency between MODIS, MISR and AERONET sAOD data. We evaluated each method by applying the technique with fewer AERONET data and comparing its output with the unused AERONET 10 data. The best performing method gives an overall error of 13 ± 2 \%, compared with an overall error of 62 \% in simply using MISR sAOD, and this method takes advantage of an empirical relationship between the A˚ ngstro¨ m exponent (AE) and ﬁne mode fraction (FMF).

	abstract = {Abstract. The optical and physical properties as well as the direct radiative forcings (DRFs) of fractionated aerosols in the urban area of the western Yangtze River Delta (YRD) are investigated with measurements from a Cimel sun photometer combined with a radiation transfer model. Ground-based observations of aerosols have much higher temporal resolutions than satellite retrievals. An initial analysis reveals the characteristics of the optical properties of different types of fractionated aerosols in the western YRD. The total aerosols, mostly composed of scattering components (93.8 \%), have mean optical depths of 0.65 at 550 nm and refractive index of 1.44 + 0.0084i at 440 nm. The fine aerosols are approximately four times more abundant and have very different compositions from coarse aerosols. The absorbing components account for only  ∼  4.6 \% of fine aerosols and 15.5 \% of coarse aerosols and have smaller sizes than the scattering aerosols within the same mode. Therefore, fine particles have stronger scattering than coarse ones, simultaneously reflecting the different size distributions between the absorbing and scattering aerosols. The relationships among the optical properties quantify the aerosol mixing and imply that approximately 15 and 27.5 \% of the total occurrences result in dust- and black-carbon-dominating mixing aerosols, respectively, in the western YRD. Unlike the optical properties, the size distributions of aerosols in the western YRD are similar to those found at other sites over eastern China on a climatological scale, peaking at radii of 0.148 and 2.94 µm. However, further analysis reveals that the coarse-dominated particles can also lead to severe haze pollution over the YRD. Observation-based estimations indicate that both fine and coarse aerosols in the western YRD exert negative DRFs, and this is especially true for fine aerosols (−11.17 W m−2 at the top of atmosphere, TOA). A higher absorption fraction leads directly to the negative DRF being further offset for coarse aerosols (−0.33 W m−2) at the TOA. Similarly, the coarse-mode DRF contributes to only 13.3 \% of the total scattering aerosols but {\textgreater} 33.7 \% to the total absorbing aerosols. A sensitivity analysis states that aerosol DRFs are not highly sensitive to their profiles in clear-sky conditions. Most of the aerosol properties and DRFs have substantial seasonality in the western YRD. The results further reveal the contributions of each component of the different size particles to the total aerosol optical depths (AODs) and DRFs. Additionally, these results can be used to improve aerosol modelling performance and the modelling of aerosol effects in the eastern regions of China.},

Researchers worldwide are analyzing the model output and will produce results likely to underlie the forthcoming Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Unprecedented in scale and attracting interest from all major climate modeling groups, CMIP5 includes “long term” simulations of twentieth-century climate and projections for the twenty-first century and beyond. Conventional atmosphere–ocean global climate models and Earth system models of intermediate complexity are for the first time being joined by more recently developed Earth system models under an experiment design that allows both types of models to be compared to observations on an equal footing. Besides the longterm experiments, CMIP5 calls for an entirely new suite of “near term” simulations focusing on recent decades and the future to year 2035. These “decadal predictions” are initialized based on observations and will be used to explore the predictability of climate and to assess the forecast system's predictive skill. The CMIP5 experiment design also allows for participation of stand-alone atmospheric models and includes a variety of idealized experiments that will improve understanding of the range of model responses found in the more complex and realistic simulations. An exceptionally comprehensive set of model output is being collected and made freely available to researchers through an integrated but distributed data archive.

The Falcon 20E aircraft operated by Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) also sampled the ash cloud on the same day. While no “wingtip-to-wingtip” co-ordination was performed, the proximity of the two aircraft allows worthwhile comparisons. Despite the high degree of inhomogeneity (e.g., column ash loadings varied by a factor of three over ∼100 km) the range of ash mass concentrations and the ratios between volcanic ash mass and concentrations of SO2, O3 and CO were consistent between the two aircraft and within expected instrumental uncertainties. The data show strong correlations between ash mass, SO2concentration and aerosol scattering with the FAAM BAe-146 data providing a specific extinction coefficient of 0.6–0.8 m2 g−1. There were significant differences in the observed ash size distribution with FAAM BAe-146 data showing a peak in the mass at ∼3.5μm (volume-equivalent diameter) and DLR data peaking at ∼10μm. Differences could not be accounted for by refractive index and shape assumptions alone. The aircraft in situ and lidar data suggest peak ash concentrations of 500–800 μg m−3with a factor of two uncertainty. Comparing the location of ash observations with the ash dispersion model output highlights differences that demonstrate the difficulties in forecasting such events and the essential nature of validating models using high quality observational data from platforms such as the FAAM BAe-146 and the DLR Falcon.},

	abstract = {The persistent open-vent activity of Mt. Etna volcano, in Sicily, is frequently punctuated by some of the most spectacular paroxysmal basaltic explosions in nature. Although magmatic gas is unquestionably the driver of these events, direct measurements of a paroxysm’s gas flux budget have remained challenging and limited in number, to date. A particularly violent paroxysmal sequence took place on Etna on December 2015, intermittently involving four of its summit craters, especially the Voragine (VOR) that had previously displayed no activity for several years. Here, we characterize the volcano’s SO2 degassing budget prior to, during and after this paroxysmal sequence, using ground-based (UV-Camera) and satellite (OMI) observations, complemented with thermal (thermal cameras and MODIS) measurements from both ground and space. We make use of the high spatial resolution of UV-cameras to resolve SO2 emissions from the erupting VOR crater for the first time, and to characterize temporal switches in degassing activity from VOR to the nearby New Southeast Crater (NSEC). Our data show that onset of paroxysmal activity on December 3-5 was marked by visible escalation in VOR SO2 fluxes (4700-8900 tons/day), in satellite-derived thermal emissions (2000 MW vs. {\textasciitilde}2-11 MW July-November 2015 average), and in OMI-derived daily SO2 masses (5.4±0.7 to 10.0±1.3 kilotonnes, kt; 0.5 kt was the average in the pre-eruptive period). Switch in volcanic activity from VOR to NSEC on December 6 was detected by increasing SO2 fluxes at the NSEC crater (up to 3460±350 tons/day), and by decaying SO2 emissions at VOR, until activity termination on December 19. Taken together, our observations infer the total degassed SO2 mass for the entire VOR paroxysmal sequence at 21,000±2730 t, corresponding to complete degassing of {\textasciitilde}1.9±0.3 Mm3 of magma, or significantly less than the measured erupted magma volumes (5.1-12 Mm3). From this mismatch, we propose that a sizeable fraction of the erupted magma during the paroxysms was stored and degassed in the volcano’s shallow plumbing system well before eruption.},

In particular, the sulphur dioxide gas released in the stratosphere leads to aerosol formation that reflects part of the incoming solar radiation, thereby affecting the climate energy balance. In this review paper, we analyse the regional climate imprints of large tropical volcanic explosive eruptions. For this purpose, we focus on the impact on three major climatic modes, located in the Atlantic (the North Atlantic Oscillation: NAO and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation: AMO) and Pacific (the El Niño Southern Oscillation, ENSO) sectors. We present an overview of the chain of events that contributes to modifying the temporal variability of these modes. Our literature review is complemented by new analyses based on observations of the instrumental era as well as on available proxy records and climate model simulations that cover the last millennium. We show that the impact of volcanic eruptions of the same magnitude or weaker than 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption on the NAO and ENSO is hard to detect, due to the noise from natural climate variability. There is however a clear impact of the direct radiative forcing resulting from tropical eruptions on the AMO index both in reconstructions and climate model simulations of the last millennium, while the impact on the ocean circulation remains model-dependent. To increase the signal to noise ratio and better evaluate the climate response to volcanic eruptions, improved reconstructions of these climatic modes and of the radiative effect of volcanic eruptions are required on a longer time frame than the instrumental era. Finally, we evaluate climate models’ capabilities to reproduce the observed and anticipated impacts and mechanisms associated with volcanic forcing, and assess their potential for seasonal to decadal prediction. We find a very large spread in the simulated responses across the different climate models. Dedicated experimental designs and analyses are therefore needed to decipher the cause for this large uncertainty.},

VolImpact was recently funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) and started in spring 2019. The main goal of the research unit is to improve our understanding of how the climate system responds to volcanic eruptions. Such an ambitious program is well beyond the capabilities of a single research group, as it requires expertise from complementary disciplines including aerosol microphysical modelling, cloud physics, climate modelling, global observations of trace gas species, clouds and stratospheric aerosols. The research goals will be achieved by building on important recent advances in modelling and measurement capabilities. Examples of the advances in the observations include the now daily near-global observations of multi-spectral aerosol extinction from the limb-scatter instruments OSIRIS, SCIAMACHY and OMPS-LP. In addition, the recently launched SAGE III/ISS and upcoming satellite missions EarthCARE and ALTIUS will provide high resolution observations of aerosols and clouds. Recent improvements in modeling capabilities within the framework of the ICON model family now enable simulations at spatial resolutions ﬁne enough to investigate details of the evolution and dynamics of the volcanic eruptive plume using the large-eddy resolving version, up to volcanic impacts on larger-scale circulation systems in the general circulation model version. When combined with state-of-the-art aerosol and cloud microphysical models, these approaches offer the opportunity to link eruptions directly to their climate forcing. These advances will be exploited in VolImpact to study the effects of volcanic eruptions consistently over the full range of spatial and temporal scales involved, addressing the initial development of explosive eruption plumes (project VolPlume), the variation of stratospheric aerosol particle size and radiative forcing caused by volcanic eruptions (VolARC), the response of clouds (VolCloud), the effects of volcanic eruptions on atmospheric dynamics (VolDyn), as well as their climate impact (VolClim).},

IAGOS builds on more almost 20 years of scientific and technological expertise gained in the research projects MOZAIC (Measurement of Ozone and Water Vapour on Airbus In-service Aircraft) and CARIBIC (Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the Atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container). The European consortium behind IAGOS includes research centres, universities, national weather services, airline operators and aviation industry. The two elements IAGOS-CORE and IAGOS-CARIBIC are complementary building blocks of one unique global atmospheric observation system. IAGOS-CORE deploys newly developed high-tech instrumentation for regular in-situ measurements of atmospheric chemical species (O3, CO, CO2, CH4, NOx, NOy, H2O), aerosols and cloud particles. Involved airlines ensure global operation of the network. In IAGOS-CARIBIC an extensively instrumented cargo container is operated as a flying laboratory aboard one aircraft. IAGOS provides data for users in science and policy including air quality forecasting, verification of CO2 emissions and Kyoto monitoring, numerical weather prediction, and validation of satellite products. It is considered a major contributor to the in-situ component of GMES Atmospheric Services. In combination with its predecessor programs MOZAIC and CARIBIC, IAGOS allocates long-term observation data of atmospheric chemical composition in the upper troposphere and lowermost stratosphere since 1994, while the most recent IAGOS-CORE aircraft went into service in 2011 and 2012.},

	abstract = {A volcanic source of variation
The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), a 50- to 70-year quasiperiodic variation of climate centered in the North Atlantic region, was long thought to be an internal oscillation of the climate system. Mann et al. now show that this variation is forced externally by episodes of high-amplitude explosive volcanism. They used an ensemble of climate models to evaluate the causes of the AMO, finding that volcanos are the most important influence, and that there is no evidence to show that it has been internally generated during the last millennium.
Science, this issue p. 1014
Past research argues for an internal multidecadal (40- to 60-year) oscillation distinct from climate noise. Recent studies have claimed that this so-termed Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation is instead a manifestation of competing time-varying effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols. That conclusion is bolstered by the absence of robust multidecadal climate oscillations in control simulations of current-generation models. Paleoclimate data, however, do demonstrate multidecadal oscillatory behavior during the preindustrial era. By comparing control and forced “Last Millennium” simulations, we show that these apparent multidecadal oscillations are an artifact of pulses of volcanic activity during the preindustrial era that project markedly onto the multidecadal (50- to 70-year) frequency band. We conclude that there is no compelling evidence for internal multidecadal oscillations in the climate system.
Explosive volcanism drives the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation.

	url = {https://acp.copernicus.org/preprints/acp-2020-1040/},
	abstract = {The contribution of volcanic emissions is argued as non-linear on the sulfur species burden. Thus, well constraining volcanic emissions inventories is necessary to better study the impacts induced by these pollution sources on the troposheric sulfur composition, as well as on sulfur species concentrations and depositions at the global surface. In this paper, the changes induced by the update of the volcanic sulfur emissions inventory on the global chemistry-transport model MOCAGE (MOdèle 5 de Chimie Atmosphérique à Grande Échelle) are studied. Unlike the current inventory [Andres and Kasgnoc (1998)], the new inventory [Carn et al. (2016, 2017)] includes contributions from both passive degassing and eruptive emissions with more accurate information. Eruptions are provided as daily total amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emitted by volcanoes, while degassing are provided as annual averages with annual uncertainties by volcanoes. Information on plumes altitudes is also available and has been used in the model. The choice is made to look at the year 2013, when a neglieable amount of eruptive volcanic SO2 10 emissions is referenced, allowing us to focus the study on the impact of passive degassing emissions on the tropospheric sulfur budget. A validation against GOME-2 SO2 total column and MODIS AOD observations shows the improvements of the model results with the new inventory. Because the global volcanic SO2 ﬂux changes from 13 Tg.yr−1 in the current inventory to 23.6 Tg.yr−1 in the new inventory, the updated inventory shows signiﬁcant differences in the global sulfur budget, mainly in the free troposphere and in the tropics. Even though volcanic SO2 emissions represent 15 \% of the total annual sulfur emis15 sions, the volcanic contribution to the tropospheric sulfate aerosol burden is 27 \%. Moreover, a sensitivity study on passive degassing emissions, using the annual uncertainties of emissions per volcanoes, also conﬁrmed the non-linear link between tropospheric sulfur species and volcanic emissions. This study highlights the necessity of estimates accurate volcanic sources in chemistry-transport models in order to properly simulate tropospheric sulfur species.},

Observations of the rate of emission and composition of volcanic plumes are essential to recognize and, in some cases, predict the state of volcanic activity. Measurements of the size and location of the plumes are important to assess the impact of the emission from sporadic or localized events to persistent or widespread processes of climatic and environmental importance. These observations provide information on volatile budgets on Earth, chemical evolution of magmas, and atmospheric circulation and dynamics. Space-based observations during the last decades have given us a global view of Earth's volcanic emission, particularly of sulfur dioxide ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}SO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}). Although none of the satellite missions were intended to be used for measurement of volcanic gas emission, specially adapted algorithms have produced time-averaged global emission budgets. These have confirmed that tropospheric plumes, produced from persistent degassing of weak sources, dominate the total emission of volcanic {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}SO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}. Although space-based observations have provided this global insight into some aspects of Earth's volcanism, it still has important limitations. The magnitude and short-term variability of lower-atmosphere emissions, historically less accessible from space, remain largely uncertain. Operational monitoring of volcanic plumes, at scales relevant for adequate surveillance, has been facilitated through the use of ground-based scanning differential optical absorption spectrometer (ScanDOAS) instruments since the beginning of this century, largely due to the coordinated effort of the Network for Observation of Volcanic and Atmospheric Change (NOVAC). In this study, we present a compilation of results of homogenized post-analysis of measurements of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}SO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} flux and plume parameters obtained during the period March 2005 to January 2017 of 32 volcanoes in NOVAC. This inventory opens a window into the short-term emission patterns of a diverse set of volcanoes in terms of magma composition, geographical location, magnitude of emission, and style of eruptive activity. We find that passive volcanic degassing is by no means a stationary process in time and that large sub-daily variability is observed in the flux of volcanic gases, which has implications for emission budgets produced using short-term, sporadic observations. The use of a standard evaluation method allows for intercomparison between different volcanoes and between ground- and space-based measurements of the same volcanoes. The emission of several weakly degassing volcanoes, undetected by satellites, is presented for the first time. We also compare our results with those reported in the literature, providing ranges of variability in emission not accessible in the past. The open-access data repository introduced in this article will enable further exploitation of this unique dataset, with a focus on volcanological research, risk assessment, satellite-sensor validation, and improved quantification of the prevalent tropospheric component of global volcanic emission.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Datasets for each volcano are made available at {\textless}span class="uri"{\textgreater}https://novac.chalmers.se{\textless}/span{\textgreater} (last access: 1 October 2020) under the CC-BY 4 license or through the DOI (digital object identifier) links provided in Table 1.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Flying wind-optimal trajectories with a fuel-optimal vertical profile reduces average fuel burn of international flights cruising at a single altitude by 1–3\%. The potential fuel savings of performing en route step climbs are not significant for many shorter domestic cargo flights that have only one step climb. Wind-optimal trajectories reduce fuel burn and travel time relative to the flight-plan route by up to 3\% for the domestic cargo flights. However, for transoceanic traffic, the fuel burn savings could be as much as 10\%. The actual savings in operations will vary from the simulation results due to differences in the aircraft models and user-defined cost indices. In general, the savings are proportional to trip length, and depend on the en route wind conditions and aircraft types.},

Wind-optimal routes exhibit on average approximately one percent less flight time and fuel burn than filed flight routes. In addition, they produce an average of 13 less conflicts in Class A airspace (18,000 feet and above). All three routing methods are qualitatively equivalent in terms of sector count distribution. These results agree with earlier studies, which investigated some combinations of these types of routes and metrics. The contribution of this paper is that it consistently compares the three routing methods across the United States using the four metrics.},

We find that the worldwide air transportation network is a scale-free small-world network. In contrast to the prediction of scale-free network models, however, we find that the most connected cities are not necessarily the most central, resulting in anomalous values of the centrality. We demonstrate that these anomalies arise because of the multicommunity structure of the network. We identify the communities in the air transportation network and show that the community structure cannot be explained solely based on geographical constraints and that geopolitical considerations have to be taken into account. We identify each city's global role based on its pattern of intercommunity and intracommunity connections, which enables us to obtain scale-specific representations of the network.},

	abstract = {Aerosols are an important component of the climate system affecting visibility, clouds, and climate. They are also transported over short and long distances with consequences for continental-scale nutrient availability. Processes that remove aerosols from the atmosphere are difficult to evaluate with observations in isolation from aerosol sources. As a result, a quantitative assessment of uncertainties in our understanding of aerosols is limited and narrowing of those uncertainties is difficult to demonstrate. In this study, we use satellite observations of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and aerosols downwind of the Kīlauea volcano during May-September 2008. We derive the SO2 emission rate, the loss rate of SO2 that is indicative of the production rate of sulfate aerosols, and the subsequent removal rate of the formed sulfate. The result is the first determination of volcanic sulfate aerosol lifetime, 40-64 hours, directly from satellite observations. The derived sulfate lifetime is significantly lower than the global average (3-5.5 days) and reflects the rapid wet scavenging of this plume. This article is protected by copyright.

	abstract = {The tropospheric response to Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) is associated with an equatorward shift in the midlatitude jet and associated storm tracks, while Strong Polar Vortex (SPV) events elicit a contrasting response. Recent analyses of the North Atlantic jet using probability density functions of a jet latitude index have identified three preferred jet latitudes, raising the question of whether the tropospheric response to SSWs and SPVs results from a change in relative frequencies of these preferred jet regimes rather than a systematic jet shift. We explore this question using atmospheric reanalysis data from 1979 to 2018 (26 SSWs and 33 SPVs), and a 202-years integration of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (92 SSWs and 68 SPVs). Following SSWs, the northern jet regime becomes less common and the central and southern regimes become more common. These changes occur almost immediately following “split” vortex events, but are more delayed following “displacement” events. In contrast, the northern regime becomes more frequent and the southern regime less frequent following SPV events. Following SSWs, composites of 500-hPa geopotential heights, surface air temperatures, and precipitation most closely resemble composites of the southern jet regime, and are generally opposite in sign to the composites of the northern jet regime. These comparisons are reversed following SPVs. Thus, one possible interpretation is that the two southernmost regimes appear to be favored following SSWs, while the southernmost regime becomes less common following SPVs.},

Flight planning and measurement analyses were supported by a refined Meteosat ash product and trajectory model analysis. The volcanic ash plume was observed with lidar directly over the volcano and up to a distance of 2700 km downwind, and up to 120 h plume ages. Aged ash layers were between a few 100 m to 3 km deep, occurred between 1 and 7 km altitude, and were typically 100 to 300 km wide. Particles collected by impactors had diameters up to 20 μm diameter, with size and age dependent composition. Ash mass concentrations were derived from optical particle spectrometers for a particle density of 2.6 g cm$^{\textrm{\&minus;3}}$ and various values of the refractive index (RI, real part: 1.59; 3 values for the imaginary part: 0, 0.004 and 0.008). The mass concentrations, effective diameters and related optical properties were compared with ground-based lidar observations. Theoretical considerations of particle sedimentation constrain the particle diameters to those obtained for the lower RI values. The ash mass concentration results have an uncertainty of a factor of two. The maximum ash mass concentration encountered during the 17 flights with 34 ash plume penetrations was below 1 mg m$^{\textrm{\&minus;3}}$. The Falcon flew in ash clouds up to about 0.8 mg m$^{\textrm{\&minus;3}}$ for a few minutes and in an ash cloud with approximately 0.2 mg m$^{\textrm{\&minus;3}}$ mean-concentration for about one hour without engine damage. The ash plumes were rather dry and correlated with considerable CO and SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ increases and O$_{\textrm{3}}$ decreases. To first order, ash concentration and SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ mixing ratio in the plumes decreased by a factor of two within less than a day. In fresh plumes, the SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ and CO concentration increases were correlated with the ash mass concentration. The ash plumes were often visible slantwise as faint dark layers, even for concentrations below 0.1 mg m$^{\textrm{\&minus;3}}$. The large abundance of volatile Aitken mode particles suggests previous nucleation of sulfuric acid droplets. The effective diameters range between 0.2 and 3 μm with considerable surface and volume contributions from the Aitken and coarse mode aerosol, respectively. The distal ash mass flux on 2 May was of the order of 500 (240–1600) kg s$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$. The volcano induced about 10 (2.5–50) Tg of distal ash mass and about 3 (0.6–23) Tg of SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ during the whole eruption period. The results of the Falcon flights were used to support the responsible agencies in their decisions concerning air traffic in the presence of volcanic ash.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We analyze tropical volcanic eruptions of different strengths with sulfur (S) injections ranging from 2.5 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Tg{\textless}/span{\textgreater} S up to 40 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Tg{\textless}/span{\textgreater} S using EVAens, the 100-member ensemble of the Max Planck Institute – Earth System Model in its low-resolution configuration (MPI-ESM-LR) with artificial volcanic forcing generated by the Easy Volcanic Aerosol (EVA) tool. Significant increases in SWV are found for the mean over all ensemble members from 2.5 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Tg{\textless}/span{\textgreater} S onward ranging between [5, 160] {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\%{\textless}/span{\textgreater}. However, for single ensemble members, the standard deviation between the control run members (0 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Tg{\textless}/span{\textgreater} S) is larger than SWV increase of single ensemble members for eruption strengths up to 20 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Tg{\textless}/span{\textgreater} S. A historical simulation using observation-based forcing files of the Mt. Pinatubo eruption, which was estimated to have emitted ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}7.5±2.5{\textless}/span{\textgreater}) {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Tg{\textless}/span{\textgreater} S, returns SWV increases slightly higher than the 10 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Tg{\textless}/span{\textgreater} S EVAens simulations due to differences in the aerosol profile shape. An additional amplification of the tape recorder signal is also apparent, which is not present in the 10 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Tg{\textless}/span{\textgreater} S run. These differences underline that it is not only the eruption volume but also the aerosol layer shape and location with respect to the cold point that have to be considered for post-eruption SWV increases. The additional tropical clear-sky SWV forcing for the different eruption strengths amounts to [0.02, 0.65] {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}W m$^{\textrm{−2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, ranging between [2.5, 4] {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\%{\textless}/span{\textgreater} of the aerosol radiative forcing in the 10 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Tg{\textless}/span{\textgreater} S scenario. The monthly cold-point temperature increases leading to the SWV increase are not linear with respect to aerosol optical depth (AOD) nor is the corresponding SWV forcing, among others, due to hysteresis effects, seasonal dependencies, aerosol profile heights and feedbacks. However, knowledge of the cold-point temperature increase allows for an estimation of SWV increases of 12 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\%{\textless}/span{\textgreater} per Kelvin increase in mean cold-point temperature. For yearly averages, power functions are fitted to the cold-point warming and SWV forcing with increasing AOD.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

These chemical species influence the atmospheric chemistry and produce ozone (O$_{\textrm{3}}$) in the troposphere. Ozone acts as a greenhouse gas and thus contributes to anthropogenic global warming. Technological trends and political decisions can help to reduce the O$_{\textrm{3}}$ effect of road traffic emissions on climate. In order to assess the O$_{\textrm{3}}$ response of such mitigation options on climate, we developed a chemistry-climate response model called TransClim (Modelling the effect of surface {\textless}em{\textgreater}Trans{\textless}/em{\textgreater}portation on {\textless}em{\textgreater}Clim{\textless}/em{\textgreater}ate). It considers road traffic emissions of NO$_{\textrm{x}}$, VOC and CO and determines the O$_{\textrm{3}}$ change and its corresponding stratospheric-adjusted radiative forcing. Using a tagging method, TransClim is further able to quantify the contribution of road traffic emissions to the O$_{\textrm{3}}$ concentration. The response model bases on lookup-tables which are generated by a set of emission variation simulations performed with the global chemistry climate model EMAC (ECHAM5 v5.3.02, MESSy v2.53.0). Evaluating TransClim against independent EMAC simulations reveals very low deviations of all considered species (0.01\&ndash;7\&thinsp;\%). Hence, TransClim is able to reproduce the results of an EMAC simulation very well. Moreover, TransClim is about 6000 times faster in computing the climate effect of an emission scenario than the complex chemistry-climate model. This makes TransClim a suitable tool to efficiently assess the climate effect of a broad range of mitigation options for road traffic or to analyse uncertainty ranges by employing Monte-Carlo simulations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {It has been 10 years since the ash cloud from the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull caused unprecedented disruption to air traffic across Europe. During this event, the London Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) provided advice and guidance on the expected location of volcanic ash in the atmosphere using observations and the atmospheric dispersion model NAME (Numerical Atmospheric-Dispersion Modelling Environment). Rapid changes in regulatory response and procedures during the eruption introduced the requirement to also provide forecasts of ash concentrations, representing a step-change in the level of interrogation of the dispersion model output. Although disruptive, the longevity of the event afforded the scientiﬁc community the opportunity to observe and extensively study the transport and dispersion of a volcanic ash cloud. We present the development of the NAME atmospheric dispersion model and modiﬁcations to its application in the London VAAC forecasting system since 2010, based on the lessons learned. Our ability to represent both the vertical and horizontal transport of ash in the atmosphere and its removal have been improved through the introduction of new schemes to represent the sedimentation and wet deposition of volcanic ash, and updated schemes to represent deep moist atmospheric convection and parametrizations for plume spread due to unresolved mesoscale motions. A good simulation of the transport and dispersion of a volcanic ash cloud requires an accurate representation of the source and we have introduced more sophisticated approaches to representing the eruption source parameters, and their uncertainties, used to initialize NAME. Finally, upper air wind ﬁeld data used by the dispersion model is now more accurate than it was in 2010. These developments have resulted in a more robust modelling system at the London VAAC, ready to provide forecasts and guidance during the next volcanic ash event.},

	abstract = {Aviation is seeking for ways to reduce its climate impact caused by CO2 emissions and non-CO2 effects. Operational measures which change overall flight altitude have the potential to reduce climate impact of individual effects, comprising CO2 but in particular non-CO2 effects. We study the impact of changes of flight altitude, specifically aircraft flying 2000 feet higher and lower, with a set of global models comprising chemistry-transport, chemistry-climate and general circulation models integrating distinct aviation emission inventories representing such alternative flight altitudes, estimating changes in climate impact of aviation by quantifying radiative forcing and induced temperature change. We find in our sensitivity study that flying lower leads to a reduction of radiative forcing of non-CO2 effects together with slightly increased CO2 emissions and impacts, when cruise speed is not modified. Flying higher increases radiative forcing of non-CO2 effects by about 10\%, together with a slight decrease of CO2 emissions and impacts. Overall, flying lower decreases aviation-induced temperature change by about 20\%, as a decrease of non-CO2 impacts by about 30\% dominates over slightly increasing CO2 impacts assuming a sustained emissions scenario. Those estimates are connected with a large but unquantified uncertainty. To improve the understanding of mechanisms controlling the aviation climate impact, we study the geographical distributions of aviation-induced modifications in the atmosphere, together with changes in global radiative forcing and suggest further efforts in order to reduce long standing uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Transboundary smoke haze caused by biomass burning frequently causes extreme air pollution episodes in maritime and continental Southeast Asia. With millions of people being aﬀected by this type of pollution every year, the task to introduce smoke haze related air quality forecasts is urgent. We investigate three severe haze episodes: June 2013 in Maritime SE Asia, induced by ﬁres in central Sumatra, and March/April 2013 and 2014 on mainland SE Asia. Based on comparisons with surface measurements of PM10 we demonstrate that the combination of the Lagrangian dispersion model NAME with emissions derived from satellite-based active-ﬁre detection provides reliable forecasts for the region. Contrasting two ﬁre emission inventories shows that using algorithms to account for ﬁre pixel obscuration by cloud or haze better captures the temporal variations and observed persistence of local pollution levels. Including up-to-date representations of fuel types in the area and using better conversion and emission factors is found to more accurately represent local concentration magnitudes, particularly for peat ﬁres. With both emission inventories the overall spatial and temporal evolution of the haze events is captured qualitatively, with some error attributed to the resolution of the meteorological data driving the dispersion process. In order to arrive at a quantitative agreement with local PM10 levels, the simulation results need to be scaled. Considering the requirements of operational forecasts, we introduce a real-time bias correction technique to the modeling system to address systematic and random modeling errors, which successfully improves the results in terms of reduced normalized mean biases and fractional gross errors.},

Their abundance and often complex patterns can be a barrier for combining different observational datasets and may cause biased estimates. To overcome this, missing values in geoscientific data are regularly infilled with estimates through univariate gap-filling techniques such as spatio-temporal interpolation. However, these mostly ignore valuable information that may be present in other dependent observed variables. Here we propose CLIMFILL, a multivariate gap-filling procedure that builds up upon simple interpolation by additionally applying a statistical imputation method that is designed to account for dependence across variables. In contrast to popular up-scaling approaches, CLIMFILL does not need a gap-free gridded "donor" variable for gap-filling. CLIMFILL is tested using gap-free ERA5 re-analysis data of ground temperature, surface layer soil moisture, precipitation, and terrestrial water storage to represent central interactions between soil moisture and climate. These observations were matched with corresponding remote sensing observations and masked where the observations have missing values. CLIMFILL successfully recovers the dependence structure among the variables across all land cover types and altitudes, thereby enabling subsequent mechanistic interpretations. Soil moisture-temperature feedback, which is underestimated in high latitude regions due to sparse satellite coverage, is adequately represented in the multivariate gap-filling. Univariate performance metrics such as correlation and bias are improved compared to spatiotemporal interpolation gap-fill for a wide range of missing values and missingness patterns. Especially estimates for surface layer soil moisture profit taking into account the multivariate dependence structure of the data. The framework al- lows tailoring the gap-filling process to different environmental conditions, domains, or specific use cases and hence can be used as a flexible tool for gap-filling a large range of remote sensing and in situ observations commonly used in climate and environmental research.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Abstract. Gas-phase chemistry and subsequent gas-to-particle conversion processes such as new particle formation, condensation, and thermodynamic partitioning have large impacts on air quality, climate, and public health through influencing the amounts and distributions of gaseous precursors and secondary aerosols. Their roles in global air quality and climate are examined in this work using the Community Earth System Model version 1.0.5 (CESM1.0.5) with the Community Atmosphere Model version 5.1 (CAM5.1) (referred to as CESM1.0.5/CAM5.1). CAM5.1 includes a simple chemistry that is coupled with a 7-mode prognostic Modal Aerosol Model (MAM7). MAM7 includes classical homogenous nucleation (binary and ternary) and activation nucleation (empirical first-order power law) parameterizations, and a highly simplified inorganic aerosol thermodynamics treatment that only simulates particulate-phase sulfate and ammonium. In this work, a new gas-phase chemistry mechanism based on the 2005 Carbon Bond Mechanism for Global Extension (CB05\_GE) and several advanced inorganic aerosol treatments for condensation of volatile species, ion-mediated nucleation (IMN), and explicit inorganic aerosol thermodynamics for sulfate, ammonium, nitrate, sodium, and chloride have been incorporated into CESM/CAM5.1-MAM7. Compared to the simple gas-phase chemistry, CB05\_GE can predict many more gaseous species, and thus could improve model performance for PM2.5, PM10, PM components, and some PM gaseous precursors such as SO2 and NH3 in several regions as well as aerosol optical depth (AOD) and cloud properties (e.g., cloud fraction (CF), cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), and shortwave cloud forcing, SWCF) on the global scale. The modified condensation and aqueous-phase chemistry could further improve the prediction of additional variables such as HNO3, NO2, and O3 in some regions, and new particle formation rate (J) and AOD on the global scale. IMN can improve the prediction of secondary PM2.5 components, PM2.5, and PM10 over Europe as well as AOD and CDNC on the global scale. The explicit inorganic aerosol thermodynamics using the ISORROPIA II model improves the prediction of all major PM2.5 components and their gaseous precursors in some regions as well as downwelling shortwave radiation, SWCF, and cloud condensation nuclei at a supersaturation of 0.5\% on the global scale. For simulations of 2001–2005 with all the modified and new treatments, the improved model predicts that on global average, SWCF increases by 2.7 W m−2, reducing the normalized mean bias (NMB) of SWCF from −5.4 to 1.2\%. Uncertainties in emissions can largely explain the inaccurate prediction of precursor gases (e.g., SO2, NH3, and NO) and primary aerosols (e.g., black carbon and primary organic matter). Additional factors leading to the discrepancies between model predictions and observations include assumptions associated with equilibrium partitioning for fine particles assumed in ISORROPIA II, irreversible gas/particle mass transfer treatment for coarse particles, uncertainties in model treatments such as dust emissions, secondary organic aerosol formation, multi-phase chemistry, cloud microphysics, aerosol–cloud interaction, dry and wet deposition, and model parameters (e.g., accommodation coefficients and prefactors of the nucleation power law) as well as uncertainties in model configuration such as the use of a coarse-grid resolution.},

	abstract = {Volcanic ash clouds can damage aircrafts during ﬂight and, thus, have the potential to disrupt air trafﬁc on a large scale, making their detection and monitoring necessary. The new retrieval algorithm VACOS (Volcanic Ash Cloud properties Obtained from SEVIRI) using the geostationary instrument MSG/SEVIRI and artiﬁcial neural networks is introduced in a companion paper. It performs pixelwise classiﬁcations and retrieves (indirectly) the mass column concentration, the cloud top height and the effective particle radius. VACOS is comprehensively validated using simulated test data, CALIOP retrievals, lidar and in situ data from aircraft campaigns of the DLR and the FAAM, as well as volcanic ash transport and dispersion multi model multi source term ensemble predictions. Speciﬁcally, emissions of the eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull (2010) and Puyehue-Cordón Caulle (2011) are considered. For ash loads larger than 0.2 g m−2 and a mass column concentration-based detection procedure, the different evaluations give probabilities of detection between 70\% and more than 90\% at false alarm rates of the order of 0.3–3\%. For the simulated test data, the retrieval of the mass load has a mean absolute percentage error of {\textasciitilde}40\% or less for ash layers with an optical thickness at 10.8 µm of 0.1 (i.e., a mass load of about 0.3–0.7 g m−2, depending on the ash type) or more, the ash cloud top height has an error of up to 10\% for ash layers above 5 km, and the effective radius has an error of up to 35\% for radii of 0.6–6 µm. The retrieval error increases with decreasing ash cloud thickness and top height. VACOS is applicable even for overlaying meteorological clouds, for example, the mean absolute percentage error of the optical depth at 10.8 µm increases by only up to {\textasciitilde}30\%. Viewing zenith angles {\textgreater}60° increase the mean percentage error by up to {\textasciitilde}20\%. Desert surfaces are another source of error. Varying geometrical ash layer thicknesses and the occurrence of multiple layers can introduce an additional error of about 30\% for the mass load and 5\% for the cloud top height. For the CALIOP data, comparisons with its predecessor VADUGS (operationally used by the DWD) show that VACOS is more robust, with retrieval errors of mass load and ash cloud top height reduced by {\textgreater}10\% and {\textgreater}50\%, respectively. Using the model data indicates an increase in detection rate in the order of 30\% and more. The reliability under a wide spectrum of atmospheric conditions and volcanic ash types make VACOS a suitable tool for scientiﬁc studies and air trafﬁc applications related to volcanic ash clouds.},

Decision-making is usually based on numerical dispersion modelling with only one model realization. Given the inherent uncertainty of such an approach, a multi-model multi-source term ensemble has been designed and evaluated for the Eyjafjallajökull eruption in May 2010. Its use for flight planning is discussed. Two multi-model ensembles were built: the first is based on the output of four dispersion models and their own implementation of ash ejection. All a priori model source terms were constrained by observational evidence of the volcanic ash cloud top as a function of time. The second ensemble is based on the same four dispersion models, which were run with three additional source terms: (i) a source term obtained from a model background constrained with satellite data (a posteriori source term), (ii) its lower-bound estimate and (iii) its upper-bound estimate. The a priori ensemble gives valuable information about the probability of ash dispersion during the early phase of the eruption, when observational evidence is limited. However, its evaluation with observational data reveals lower quality compared to the second ensemble. While the second ensemble ash column load and ash horizontal location compare well to satellite observations, 3D ash concentrations are negatively biased. This might be caused by the vertical distribution of ash, which is too much diluted in all model runs, probably due to defaults in the a posteriori source term and vertical transport and/or diffusion processes in all models. Relevant products for the air traffic management are horizontal maps of ash concentration quantiles (median, 75 \%, 99 \%) at a finely resolved flight level grid as well as cross sections. These maps enable cost-optimized consideration of volcanic hazards and could result in much fewer flight cancellations, reroutings and traffic flow congestions. In addition, they could be used for route optimization in the areas where ash does not pose a direct and urgent threat to aviation, including the aspect of aeroplane maintenance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Two turbine blades made of precision cast polycrystalline superalloy IN-792 have been examined after service exposure under engine conditions typical for industrial gas turbines. This study is compared to a previous study with focus on deformation and damage mechanisms in IN-792 during thermal mechanical fatigue testing performed under laboratory conditions. The failure of the two turbine blades is explained as a combination of two damage mechanisms, mechanical and chemical damage. In the current investigation, type I hot corrosion and creep are the two dominant damage mechanisms. The type I hot corrosion is confirmed by the presence of Ti-sulfides and sulfur in free form at the grain boundaries, which has caused embrittlement and loss of resistance to crack growth. In turn, this has shortened the turbine blade life dramatically and intercrystalline failure is the dominant damage mechanism. Almost all cracks have propagated intercrystalline in the two turbine blades. In the previous study, mechanical damage mechanism is the dominant mechanism and for the highest temperature also oxidation give is contribution. In the previous study, almost all cracks propagated transcrystalline. When exposed to laboratory conditions, the areas around cracks are more plastically deformed compared to the area around the cracks in the turbine blades. In the two studies, dynamic recrystallization has occurred at the grain boundaries.},

To deepen the insight and understanding of hot corrosion, herein, we provide a detailed discussion on hot corrosion induced by molten sulfate salt, in which Na2SO4 is the main chemical reactant. The hot corrosion is triggered and sustained by the negative solubility gradient of protective oxide from the oxide/salt interface to salt/gas interface. In this work, we reviewed several key factors, including temperature, gas composition, molten salt composition, alloy element and external stress, influencing the hot corrosion of alloy beneath the molten salt. The application of anti-corrosion coating seems to be the most effective and commercial mothed to mitigate hot corrosion. Therefore, the progress of the development of effective coatings, e.g., Ni-Cr coatings, aluminide coatings, silicide coatings and MCrAlY(X) coatings, has also been summarized.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Aerosol mass and the absorbing fraction are important variables, needed to constrain the role of atmospheric particles in the Earth radiation budget, both directly and indirectly through CCN activation. In particular, their monitoring in remote areas and mountain sites is essential for determining source regions, elucidating the mechanisms of long range transport of anthropogenic pollutants, and validating regional and global models. Since March 2006, aerosol mass and black carbon concentration have been monitored at the Nepal Climate Observatory-Pyramid, a permanent high-altitude research station located in the Khumbu valley at 5079 m a.s.l. below Mt. Everest. The first two-year averages of PM1 and PM1−10 mass were 1.94 μg m−3 and 1.88 μg m−3, with standard deviations of 3.90 μg m−3 and 4.45 μg m−3, respectively, while the black carbon concentration average is 160.5 ng m−3, with a standard deviation of 296.1 ng m−3. Both aerosol mass and black carbon show well defined annual cycles, with a maximum during the pre-monsoon season and a minimum during the monsoon. They also display a typical diurnal cycle during all the seasons, with the lowest particle concentration recorded during the night, and a considerable increase during the afternoon, revealing the major role played by thermal winds in influencing the behaviour of atmospheric compounds over the high Himalayas. The aerosol concentration is subject to high variability: in fact, as well as frequent "background conditions" (55\% of the time) when BC concentrations are mainly below 100 ng m−3, concentrations up to 5 μg m−3 are reached during some episodes (a few days every year) in the pre-monsoon seasons. The variability of PM and BC is the result of both short-term changes due to thermal wind development in the valley, and long-range transport/synoptic circulation. At NCO-P, higher concentrations of PM1 and BC are mostly associated with regional circulation and westerly air masses from the Middle East, while the strongest contributions of mineral dust arrive from the Middle East and regional circulation, with a special contribution from North Africa and South-West Arabian Peninsula in post-monsoon and winter season.},

	abstract = {Alkali chlorides and sulfates are well-known corrosive species found on superheater and reheater boiler tube deposits. The corrosivity of alkali chlorides toward Fe–Cr alloys is connected to the formation of molecular chlorine at the oxide surface. Chlorine can accelerate metal oxidation, establishing a self-sustained cyclic process of metal chloride and metal oxide formation, a corrosion phenomenon referred to as “active oxidation”. In the convective zone of a boiler, chlorine can be released by either sulfation of alkali chlorides by SOx or reaction of alkali salts (NaCl/KCl) present in deposits on heat-exchanger surfaces with metal and/or their oxides or both. To minimize the possible risk of corrosion induced by alkali chlorides, conversion of these chlorides to sulfates is discussed as an attractive solution. The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of higher SO2 concentrations, during oxy-fuel combustion, on in-deposit sulfation of chloride salts and related corrosion mechanisms. To signify the influence of SO2, one exposure test (OI) was performed without SO2, while the other exposure test (OII) was performed with high SO2 content (1.5\%), possibly obtained during oxy-fuel combustion while using a sulfur-rich coal. Synthetic NaCl salt was used as a deposit layer over alloy 310 (Fe–25Cr–21Ni) to evaluate its corrosion behavior at 650 °C in both atmospheres. The exposure atmosphere represents a typical oxy-fuel flue gas composition (test OI, 77.5\% CO2 + 4.5\% O2 + 18\% H2O; test OII, 76\% CO2 + 4.5\% O2 + 18\% H2O + 1.5\% SO2). The exposure duration in each test was equal to 350 h. To evaluate the influence of the temperature, FactSage calculations were performed. Electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) was used to observe the extent of corrosion and elemental distribution at sample cross-sections to identify corrosion products. The depth of attack and corrosion progress faced by alloy 310 beneath the NaCl deposit was significantly reduced in the presence of SO2 in the exposed atmosphere. In the absence of SO2, “active oxidation” was the dominant corrosion mechanism, along with strong evidence of internal attack, while in the presence of SO2, none of these corrosion mechanisms was observed. Instead, the local sulfidation attack observed in the presence of SO2 points toward the possibility of type II “hot corrosion”.},

	abstract = {Aviation emission of gas phase pollutants and particulate matter contribute to global radiative forcing and regional air quality degradation near airports. It is important to understand the formation and time evolution of these pollutants inside aircraft engines to design strategies for emission reduction. A physics and chemistry based zero-dimensional (0D) gas parcel model with detailed jet fuel chemistry and soot microphysics has been developed to predict the time evolution, formation history, and emission index (EI) of key combustion gases and size-resolved soot particles of an aircraft engine. The model was applied to a CFM56-2-C1 aircraft engine for idle operating condition, for which comprehensive measured data from the Aircraft Particle Emissions eXperiment (APEX) campaign are available. The measured EI data of four major pollutants, including CO, NOx (NO+NO2), total hydrocarbon (HC) mass, and soot mass, were used to optimize the model parameters. The model predicts the time evolution of concentration of CO, NOx, HC, soot size distribution, CO2, H2O, SO2, NO, NO2, HONO, HNO3, SO3, H2SO4, O2, H, H2, O, OH, HO2, H2O2, and some HC species in the combustor and turbine. Reasonable agreement was found between the simulations and the measurements. It was found for idle operating condition that, for most of the combustion products, concentrations did not change significantly in the turbine and nozzle, however, HONO, H2SO4, and HO2 concentrations did change by more than a factor of 10, while NOx, NO, NO2, O, OH, soot particle mass and soot particle number by less than a factor of 2. The developed model is computationally efficient and can be used to, study detailed chemical and microphysical processes during combustion, investigate the effects of different fuel compositions and operating conditions on aircraft emissions, and assist air quality study near aircraft emission sources.},

Eleven models participated, and from these models the simulated surface concentrations, vertical profiles and budget terms were submitted. This study focuses on simulated budget terms for the sources and sinks of SO2 and sulfate in three polluted regions in the Northern Hemisphere, i.e., eastern North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia. Qualitatively, features of the sulfur cycle are modeled quite consistently between models, such as the relative importance of dry deposition as a removal mechanism for SO2, the importance of aqueous phase oxidation over gas phase oxidation for SO2, and the importance of wet over dry deposition for removal of sulfate aerosol. Quantitatively, however, models may show large differences, especially for cloud-related processes, i.e., aqueous phase oxidation of SO2 and sulfate wet deposition. In some cases a specific behavior can be related to the treatment of oxidants for aqueous phase SO2 oxidation, or the vertical resolution applied in models. Generally, however, the differences between models appear to be related to simulated cloud (micro-)physics and distributions, whereas differences in vertical transport efficiencies related to convection play an additional rôle. The estimated sulfur column burdens, lifetimes and export budgets vary between models by about a factor of 2 or 3. It can be expected that uncertainties in related effects which are derived from global sulfur model calculations, such as direct and indirect climate forcing estimates by sulfate aerosol, are at least of similar magnitude.},

The results show that aerosols from either source cause a long-term cooling of North Atlantic sea surface temperatures, with the patterns a combination of atmospheric aerosol effects and an aerosol-induced strengthening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. The response to North American emissions is larger since prevailing winds cause wider aerosol spread over the Atlantic, collocated with climatological cloud cover.

The overall cooling effects of AA, which mask a portion of global warming, have been the subject of many studies but still have large uncertainty. The interhemispheric contrast in AA forcing has also been demonstrated to induce a major shift in atmospheric circulation. However, the zonal redistribution of AA emissions since start of the 20th century, with a notable decline in the Western Hemisphere (North America and Europe) and a continuous increase in the Eastern Hemisphere (South Asia and East Asia), has received less attention.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Here we utilize four sets of single-model initial-condition large-ensemble simulations with various combinations of external forcings to quantify the radiative and circulation responses due to the spatial redistribution of AA forcing during 1980–2020.

Overall, the FF aerosol leads to a northward shift of the Hadley cell and an equatorward shift of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) jet stream. Here, two sets of regional FF simulations (Fix\_EastFF1920 and Fix\_WestFF1920) are performed to separate the roles of zonally asymmetric aerosol forcings. We find that the WH aerosol forcing, located in the extratropics, dominates the northward shift of the Hadley cell by inducing an interhemispheric imbalance in radiative forcing. On the other hand, the EH aerosol forcing, located closer to the tropics, dominates the equatorward shift of the NH jet stream. The consistent relationship between the jet stream shift and the top-of-atmosphere net solar flux (FSNTOA) gradient suggests that the latter serves as a rule-of-thumb guidance for the expected shift of the NH jet stream.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The surface effect of EH aerosol forcing (mainly from low- to midlatitudes) is confined more locally and only induces weak warming over the northeastern Pacific and North Atlantic.

The organic trace gases included alkanes, isoprene, aromatics, iodomethane, and trichloroethylene, oxygenates such as acetone, methanol, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, and longer-lived tracer species such as chlorofluorocarbons and halochloroflurocarbons. The aim of the UTOPIHAN-ACT project was to study the chemical impact of deep convection on the continental upper troposphere. A Lear Jet aircraft, based in Germany, was flown at heights between 6 and 13 km in the region 59◦N–42◦N to 7◦W–13◦E during July 2003. Overall, the convectively influenced measurements presented here show a weaker variability lifetime dependence of trace gases than similar measurements collected over the Mediterranean region under more stable high-pressure conditions. Several cases of convective outflow are identified by the elevated mixing ratios of organic species relative to quiescent background conditions, with both biogenic and anthropogenic influences detectable in the upper troposphere. Enhancement at higher altitudes, notably of species with relatively short chemical lifetimes such as benzene, toluene, and even isoprene indicates deep convection over short timescales during summertime. The impact of deep convection on the local upper tropospheric formaldehyde and HOx budgets is assessed.},

Ground measurements of total hydroperoxide were made at Teca´mac University, about 35 km NW of Mexico City. In the air and on the ground, peroxide mixing ratios near the source region were generally near 1 ppbv. Strong southerly ﬂow resulted in transport of pollutants from Mexico City to two downwind surface sites on several ﬂight days. On these days, it was observed that peroxide concentrations slightly decreased as the G-1 ﬂew progressively downwind. This observation is consistent with low or negative net peroxide production rates calculated for the source region and is due to the very high NOx concentrations in the Mexico City plateau. However, relatively high values of peroxide were observed at takeoff and landing near Veracruz, a site with much higher humidity and lower NOx concentrations.},

The median concentration of total hydroperoxide was 5.2 ppbv, with median concentrations of 2.4, 1.7, and 0.97 ppbv for H2O2, MHP, and HMHP respectively. In the free troposphere, H2O2 concentration correlated with the concentration of its precursors, ozone, and water vapor. H2O2 profiles do not show elevated concentrations in the boundary layer, in contrast to vertical profiles of primary pollutants. The combination of high NOx concentrations that inhibited peroxide formation, and peroxide loss through deposition and reaction with OH, led to markedly lower peroxide concentrations within urban and power plant plumes. Photochemical calculations performed to estimate the magnitude of in-plume peroxide depression showed reasonable agreement with observations.},

An overview of H2O2, CH3OOH, and CH2O across the geographic and temporal range of these campaigns is presented. H2O2, CH3OOH, and CH2O mixing ratios and variability were larger during INTEX-NA compared to TOPSE and SONEX. Mean H2O2, CH3OOH, and CH2O were 1390, 440, and 480 pptv, respectively, more than two times higher than TOPSE measurements and an order of magnitude higher than SONEX measurements. This is attributed to higher solar radiation levels and the more polluted conditions of INTEX-NA. Mixing ratios and variability decreased with altitude for all three gases and on all three campaigns, except for CH3OOH during TOPSE. The impact of convection on H2O2, CH3OOH, and CH2O is also discussed. Using the ratio H2O2/CH3OOH, convectively influenced air parcels were found to be enhanced in CH3OOH, CH2O, CO, NO, and NO2 while H2O2 and HNO3 were depleted by wet removal. Biomass burning was also shown to increase H2O2, CH3OOH, and CH2O mixing ratios up to 1.5, 2, and 1 ppbv, respectively, even after 4–5 days of transit. Results from this study show considerable variability in H2O2, CH3OOH, and CH2O throughout the North American and North Atlantic troposphere. The variability in the upper troposphere is driven by local photochemical production and transport via regional convection and long-range pathways, suggesting transport mechanisms are important factors to include in photochemical models simulating H2O2, CH3OOH, CH2O, and HOx.},

	abstract = {For the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games full-scale control (FSC) of atmospheric pollution was implemented to improve the air quality from 20 July to 20 September 2008, resulting in a significant decrease in the emission of pollutants in urban Beijing, especially vehicular emissions. The combination of reduced emissions and weather condition changes provided us with a unique opportunity to investigate urban atmospheric chemistry. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and organic peroxides play significant roles in atmospheric processes, such as the cycling of HOx radicals and the formation of secondary sulfate aerosols and secondary organic aerosols. We measured atmospheric H2O2 and organic peroxides in urban Beijing, at the Peking University campus, from 12 July to 30 September, before and during the FSC. The major peroxides observed were H2O2, methyl hydroperoxide (MHP), and peroxyacetic acid (PAA), having maximal mixing ratios of 2.34, 0.95, and 0.17 ppbv (parts per billion by volume), respectively. Other organic peroxides were detected occasionally, such as bis-hydroxymethyl hydroperoxide, hydroxymethyl hydroperoxide, ethyl hydroperoxide, and 1-hydroxyethyl hydroperoxide. On sunny days the concentrations of H2O2, MHP, and PAA exhibited pronounced diurnal variations, with a peak in the afternoon (1500–1900) and, occasionally, a second peak in the evening (2000–0200). The night peaks can be attributed to local night production from the ozonolysis of alkenes, coupled with the reaction between NO3 radicals and organic compounds. Sunny-day weather dominated during 16–26 July, and we found that the concentrations of H2O2, MHP, and PAA increased strikingly on 22–26 July, compared with the concentrations during 16–19 July. This effect was mainly attributed to the NOx (NO and NO2) decline because of the FSC, due to (i) the suppressing effect of NO and NO2 on the production of peroxides and (ii) the indirect effect of reduced NOx on the concentration of peroxides via O3 production in the volatile organic compound-sensitive area. Although the time period from 29 July to 15 August fell within the FSC, the concentrations of H2O2, MHP, and PAA decreased significantly. This can be explained by a combination of chemical and physical factors during this period, when rainy- and cloudy-day weather dominated. Weaker irradiation and lower temperatures resulted in a lower photochemical production of peroxides; the higher humidity resulted in their greater loss through their aqueous-phase oxidation of S(IV) and through heterogeneous removal, and lower temperatures and higher nighttime humidity resulted in a quicker surface deposition of peroxides. Furthermore, our observations seem to imply that the heterogeneous removal of H2O2 is faster than that of MHP, as indicated by the strong negative correlation between the H2O2-to-MHP ratio and the aerosol surface area.},

The experiment used airborne in situ and remote sensing measurements of trace gases, radiation, and aerosols, combined with model simulations, to describe the major processes that control evolution of ozone and oxidants during the winter-spring transition. This paper introduces the major scientific questions of the TOPSE experiment, describes the conduct of the mission, and introduces the scientific results discussed in a series of companion papers in this special section. Among the significant findings of the experiment was that tropospheric ozone increases from winter to spring were dominated by in situ photochemical production in the troposphere, rather than by transport from the stratosphere. Also unique observations of widespread surface ozone depletion events, and of seasonal evolution of trace gases and aerosols as a function of latitude and altitude, were obtained over the course of the mission.},

The H2O2 mixing ratio varied from below the detection limit of about 0.12 ppbv up to 3.89 ppbv, showing a latitudinal dependence with generally higher values around the equator and decreasing values poleward. The shape of the latitudinal H2O2 distribution agrees well with an analytical steady state expression for H2O2 using the measured H2O and O3 distribution and a wind dependent H2O2 deposition rate. The ROOH mixing ratio varied from below the detection limit of about 0.08 ppbv up to 1.25 ppbv with qualitatively the same latitudinal dependence as H2O2. The observed ratio ROOH/(ROOH + H2O2) varied between 0.17 and 0.98 showing higher values at the lowest H2O2 mixing ratios at high latitudes. The measured H2O2 mixing ratio shows a significant diurnal variation with a maximum around 14:00 local time, explicable by a superposition of the photochemical H2O2 production with a constant H2O2 deposition rate. Four independent estimations of the average effective H2O2 deposition rate inferred from the H2O2 decrease in the night, from the midday H2O2 production deficit (as derived from comparison with a photochemical model and from the daily ozone loss), and from the offset in the latitudinal H2O2 distribution, were consistent. An episode of maximum H2O2 concentration suggests the possibility of its formation in clouds.},

Cloud water concentrations were found to be similar to those reported from another high-elevation location in the southeastern United States. Cloud water samples collected during these periods showed a wide range of levels (∼ 0 – 219 μM/L ) and average values of 38 μM/L and 44 μM/L for the entire sampling seasons of 1988 and 1987, respectively. Significant seasonal variation was noted both in 1987 and 1988, with cloud water levels of hydrogen peroxide much higher in the summer than in the fall. Gas-phase hydrogen peroxide levels ranged from the detection limit (0.1 ppbv) to above 4 ppbv. Gas-phase hydrogen peroxide demonstrated a nighttime maximum in the summer but not in the fall. The measurements taken in the fall were significantly lower than those taken during the summer, possibly due at least in part to seasonal variation. Atmospheric hydrogen peroxide levels were found to be increasing during stagnating high-pressure systems and were found to correspond to the back trajectory of the air mass with the highest concentrations corresponding to continental air masses. The hydrogen peroxide concentration was also found to be affected by radical formation from ozone and by loss processes such as wet and dry deposition.},

	abstract = {Distributions of aerosol-associated soluble ions over much of the South Pacific were determined by sampling from the NASA DC-8 as part of the Pacific Exploratory Mission (PEM) Tropics campaign. The mixing ratios of all ionic species were surprisingly low throughout the free troposphere (2–12 km), despite the pervasive influence from biomass burning plumes advecting over the South Pacific from the west during PEM-Tropics. At the same time, the specific activity of 7Be frequently exceeded 1000 fCi m−3 through much of the depth of the troposphere. These distributions indicate that the plumes must have been efficiently scavenged by precipitation (removing the soluble ions), but that the scavenging must have occurred far upwind of the DC-8 sampling regions (otherwise 7Be activities would also have been low). This inference is supported by large enhancements of HNO3 and carboxylic acids in many of the plumes, as these soluble acidic gases would also be readily scavenged in any precipitation events. Decreasing mixing ratios of NH4+ with altitude in all South Pacific regions sampled provide support for recent suggestions that oceanic emissions of NH3 constitute a significant source far from continents. Our sampling below 2 km reaffirms the latitudinal pattern in the methylsulfonate/non-sea-salt sulfate (MSA/nss SO4=) molar ratio established through surface-based and shipboard sampling, with values increasing from {\textless}0.05 in the tropics to nearly 0.6 at 70°S. However, we also found very high values of this ratio (0.2–0.5) at 10 km altitude above the intertropical convergence zone near 10°N. It appears that wet convective pumping of dimethylsulfide from the tropical marine boundary layer is responsible for the high values of the MSA/nss SO4= ratio in the tropical upper troposphere. This finding complicates use of this ratio to infer the zonal origin of biogenic S transported long distances.},

The scheme extends the particle-based microphysics scheme with a Monte Carlo coalescence available in libcloudph++ to the aqueous-phase chemical processes occurring within cloud droplets. The representation of chemical processes focuses on the aqueous-phase oxidation of the dissolved SO2 by O3 and H2O2. The particle-based microphysics and chemistry scheme allows for tracking of the changes in the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) distribution caused by both collisions between cloud droplets and aqueous-phase oxidation.

 The scheme is implemented in C++ and equipped with bindings to Python. The scheme can be used on either a CPU or a GPU, and is distributed under the GPLv3 license. Here, the particle-based microphysics and chemistry scheme is tested in a simple 0-dimensional adiabatic parcel model and then used in a 2-dimensional prescribed flow framework. The results are discussed with a focus on changes to the CCN sizes and comparison with other model simulations discussed in the literature.},

	abstract = {Clouds play an important role in the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfate, since aqueous phase sulfur dioxide oxidation is typically much faster than oxidation in the gas phase. Important aqueous phase oxidants include hydrogen peroxide, ozone and oxygen (catalyzed by trace metals). Because quantities of emitted sulfur dioxide in China are so large, however, it is possible that they exceed the capacity of regional clouds for sulfate production, leading to enhanced long-range transport of emitted SO2 and its oxidation product, sulfate. In order to assess the ability of regional clouds to support aqueous sulfur oxidation, four field campaigns were conducted in 2007 and 2008 at Mt. Tai in eastern China. Single and 2-stage Caltech Active Strand Cloudwater Collectors were used to collect bulk and drop size-resolved cloudwater samples, respectively. Key species that determine aqueous phase sulfur oxidation were analyzed, including cloudwater pH, S(IV), H2O2, Fe, and Mn. Gas phase SO2, O3, and H2O2 were also measured continuously during the campaigns. A wide range of cloud pH values was observed, from 2.6 to 7.6; 60\% of cloud samples had a pH between 3 and 5. H2O2 was found to be an important sulfur oxidant, especially at cloudwater pH lower than 5. H2O2 was the most important oxidant in 68\% of the cloud sampling periods. High concentrations of residual H2O2 were observed in many periods, especially in summer, implying a substantial capacity for additional sulfur oxidation. O3 was an important oxidant when cloudwater pH was higher than approximately 5–5.3, and was the most important oxidant in 20\% of the studied periods. Aqueous sulfur oxidation by O2 (catalyzed by Fe and Mn) was found to be the fastest sulfate production pathway in 12\% of the cases. Observed chemical heterogeneity among cloud drop populations was found to enhance rates of S(IV) oxidation by ozone and enhance or slow metal-catalyzed S(IV) autooxidation rates in some periods. These effects were found to be only of minor importance for the total S(IV) oxidation rate, however, as H2O2 was the dominant S(IV) oxidant during most periods.},

	abstract = {Sulfur chemistry has been incorporated in the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate Model in an internally consistent manner with other parameterizations in the model. The model predicts mixing ratios of dimethylsulfide (DMS), SO2, SO42−, H2O2. Processes that control the mixing ratio of these species include the emissions of DMS and SO2, transport of each species, gas- and aqueous-phase chemistry, wet deposition, and dry deposition of species. Modeled concentrations agree quite well with observations for DMS and H2O2, fairly well for SO2, and not as well for SO42−. The modeled SO42− tends to underestimate observed SO42− at the surface and overestimate observations in the upper troposphere. The SO2 and SO42− species were tagged according to the chemical production pathway and whether the sulfur was of anthropogenic or biogenic origin. Although aqueous-phase reactions in cloud accounted for 81\% of the sulfate production rate, only ∼50–60\% of the sulfate burden in the troposphere was derived from cloud chemistry. Because cloud chemistry is an important source of sulfate in the troposphere, the importance of H2O2 concentrations and pH values was investigated. When prescribing H2O2 concentrations to clear-sky values instead of predicting H2O2, the global-averaged, annual-averaged in-cloud production of sulfate increased. Setting the pH of the drops to 4.5 also increased the in-cloud production of sulfate. In both sensitivity simulations, the increased in-cloud production of sulfate decreased the burden of sulfate because less SO2 was available for gas-phase conversion, which contributes more efficiently to the tropospheric sulfate burden than does aqueous-phase conversion.},

	abstract = {Tropospheric data from a number of aircraft campaigns have been gridded onto global maps, forming “data composites” of chemical species important in ozone photochemistry. Although these are not climatologies in the sense of a long temporal average, these data summaries are useful for providing a picture of the global distributions of these species and are a start to creating observations-based climatologies. Using aircraft measurements from a number of campaigns, we have averaged observations of O3, CO, NO, NOx, HNO3, PAN, H2O2, CH3OOH, HCHO, CH3COCH3, C2H6, and C3H8 onto a 5° latitude by 5° longitude horizontal grid with a 1-km vertical resolution. These maps provide information about the distributions at various altitudes, but also clearly show that direct observations of the global troposphere are still very limited. A set of regions with 10°–20° horizontal extent has also been chosen wherein there is sufficient data to study vertical profiles. These profiles are particularly valuable for comparison with model results, especially when a full suite of chemical species can be compared simultaneously. The O3 and NO climatologies generated from measurements obtained during commercial aircraft flights associated writh the MOZAIC and NOXAR programs are incorporated with the data composites at 10–11 km. As an example of the utility of these data composites, observations are compared to results from two global chemical transport models, MOZART and IMAGES, to help identify incorrect emission sources, incorrect strength of convection, and missing chemistry in the models. These comparisons suggest that in MOZART the NOx biomass burning emissions may be too low and convection too weak and that the transport of ozone from the stratosphere in IMAGES is too great. The ozone profiles from the data composites are compared with ozonesonde climatologies and show that in some cases the aircraft data agree with the long-term averages, but in others, such as in the western Pacific during PEM-Tropics-A, agreement is lacking. Finally, the data composites provide temporal and spatial information, which can help identify the locations and seasons where new measurements would be most valuable. All of the data composites presented here are available via the Internet (http://aoss.engin.umich.edu/SASSarchive/).},

	abstract = {Abstract This article provides an overview of the NASA Atmospheric Tomography (ATom) mission and a summary of selected scientific findings to date. ATom was an airborne measurements and modeling campaign aimed at characterizing the composition and chemistry of the troposphere over the most remote regions of the Pacific, Southern, Atlantic, and Arctic Oceans, and examining the impact of anthropogenic and natural emissions on a global scale. These remote regions dominate global chemical reactivity and are exceptionally important for global air quality and climate. ATom data provide the in situ measurements needed to understand the range of chemical species and their reactions, and to test satellite remote sensing observations and global models over large regions of the remote atmosphere. Lack of data in these regions, particularly over the oceans, has limited our understanding of how atmospheric composition is changing in response to shifting anthropogenic emissions and physical climate change. ATom was designed as a global-scale tomographic sampling mission with extensive geographic and seasonal coverage, tropospheric vertical profiling, and detailed speciation of reactive compounds and pollution tracers. ATom flew the NASA DC-8 research aircraft over four seasons to collect a comprehensive suite of measurements of gases, aerosols, and radical species from the remote troposphere and lower stratosphere on four global circuits from 2016 to 2018. Flights maintained near-continuous vertical profiling of 0.15–13-km altitudes on long meridional transects of the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean basins. Analysis and modeling of ATom data have led to the significant early findings highlighted here.},

	abstract = {Feedbacks between air pollutants and meteorology play a crucial role in the direction of the response of future climate and air pollution. These feedbacks are important to understand and quantify the potential impact of adaptation and mitigation policies setup for protecting the population against air pollution and heat stress. We review the interactions between climate and air pollution, with special focus on the projections of air pollution under different future climate scenarios and time horizons, based on a literature review of research articles and reports from the last decade. The assessment focuses on 1) the specific impacts of climate change on air pollution and natural particle and precursor emissions in Europe in the near future (2030), by mid-century (2050) and by end of the century (2100), 2) impacts on air pollution due to changes in emissions vs. changes in climate, 3) feedbacks from air pollution on climate, 4) impacts of climate change on wildland fires and air pollutant levels, and 5) the role of adaptation and mitigation policies on climate change and air pollution. Available literature to a large extent suggests that ozone concentrations will likely increase in the second half of the century by up to 9 ppb [−4 + 9.3], while in the first half of the century, changes are much smaller and are up to ±1.5 ppb. These changes are mainly attributed to increased temperatures and emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds, but also depends on the models and scenarios used in these studies. On the other hand, the predicted changes in particle concentrations and chemical composition are uncertain and much smaller. Similar to ozone, larger changes in the particle concentrations are projected in the second half of the century. The main conclusion from this review is that the estimated changes in pollutant levels in the future vary significantly depending on the applied model systems, as well as the different emission or meteorological scenarios used in the different studies. Nevertheless, studies generally agree on the overall trend of the changes in pollutant levels due to climate change, in particular in the second half of the century.},

The centrosymmetric arrangement of the MA cations that provide zero total dipole moment configuration results in the lowest energy state profiles under pressure, while the non-centrosymmetric scheme displays a unique behaviour. Despite being overall unpolarised, the latter calculated with PBEsol leads to a rigid shift of energy from the profile obtained from the dispersive vdW-DF-cx functional. It is noteworthy that the energy profile responsible for the maximum polarised configuration nevertheless takes the second place in total energy under pressure.},

	url = {https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU23/EGU23-2685.html},
	abstract = {Near-term climate forcers (NTCF) are a group of chemically and radiatively active constituents that have a relatively short lifetime in the atmosphere ({\textless}20 years). They can exert effects on the climate, important for the future rate of climate warming, and in elevated concentrations at the lowest most levels of the atmosphere can lead to poor air quality and detrimental impacts on human health. Two important NTCFs that are considered in this study are tropospheric O3 and fine particulate matter (with a diameter less than 2.5 microns \&\#8211; PM2.5). Future climate mitigation scenarios that seek to limit future temperature increases, and include reductions in air pollutant emissions, need to consider the impact on climate, air quality and human health from changes in NTCFs. Here we use results from UKESM1 (an Earth system model with interactive chemistry and aerosols) in different future sensitivity scenarios that consider air pollutant emission mitigation, future climate change and land-use change, conducted as part of the Aerosol and Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP). We assess the impact on climate (in terms of effective radiative forcing), air pollutants (in terms of change in ambient surface concentrations) and human health (in terms of long-term adult mortality from exposure to ambient air pollutants) by comparing the results from these sensitivity scenarios to the future reference scenario ssp370, a scenario that involves low mitigation of climate and air pollutants.Scenarios that involve combined strong mitigation of aerosols and O3 precursors, including large reductions in global CH4 concentrations, produce the largest benefits to climate (an ERF of -1.2 Wm-2), air quality (10-25\% reduction in O3 and PM2.5 concentrations) and human health ({\textgreater}25\% reduction in the rate of long-term premature mortality). Benefits to health are largest across Asia for these scenarios (a 44\% reduction in the mortality rate). If global CH4 concentrations are not reduced or aerosol precursors emissions are reduced in isolation, then there is a detrimental impact to future climate but there are still improvements to future air quality and a reduction in the long-term air pollutant health burden. If climate and air quality mitigation measures are not enacted on top of ssp370 then there is a penalty to global climate, a detrimental impact on air pollutant concentrations and an increase in the long-term air pollutant health burden across certain regions (e.g. by 20\% over Africa). Considering only the impacts from climate change show increases in air pollutant concentrations over some continental regions and also an increase in the long-term rate of premature mortality by more than 10\% over Europe and parts of Asia, offsetting some of the benefits achieved from emission mitigation measures. Quantifying co-benefits and trade-offs between climate, air quality, and human health together in this way, enables policy makers to understand the outcomes of different mitigation strategies and to identify pathways with maximum benefits across all three axes.},

	abstract = {It is widely expected that global emissions of atmospheric aerosols and their precursors will decrease strongly throughout the remainder of the 21st century, due to emission reduction policies enacted to protect human health. For instance, global emissions of aerosols and their precursors are projected to decrease by as much as 80 \% by the year 2100, according to the four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. The removal of aerosols will cause unintended climate consequences, including an unmasking of global warming from long-lived greenhouse gases. We use the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Coupled Climate Model version 3 (GFDL CM3) to simulate future climate over the 21st century with and without the aerosol emission changes projected by each of the RCPs in order to isolate the radiative forcing and climate response resulting from the aerosol reductions. We find that the projected global radiative forcing and climate response due to aerosol decreases do not vary significantly across the four RCPs by 2100, although there is some mid-century variation, especially in cloud droplet effective radius, that closely follows the RCP emissions and energy consumption projections. Up to 1 W m−2 of radiative forcing may be unmasked globally from 2005 to 2100 due to reductions in aerosol and precursor emissions, leading to average global temperature increases up to 1 K and global precipitation rate increases up to 0.09 mm day−1. However, when using a version of CM3 with reduced present-day aerosol radiative forcing (−1.0 W m−2), the global temperature increase for RCP8.5 is about 0.5 K, with similar magnitude decreases in other climate response parameters as well. Regionally and locally, climate impacts can be much larger than the global mean, with a 2.1 K warming projected over China, Japan, and Korea due to the reduced aerosol emissions in RCP8.5, as well as nearly a 0.2 mm day−1 precipitation increase, a 7 g m−2 LWP decrease, and a 2 μm increase in cloud droplet effective radius. Future aerosol decreases could be responsible for 30–40 \% of total climate warming (or 10–20 \% with weaker aerosol forcing) by 2100 in East Asia, even under the high greenhouse gas emissions scenario (RCP8.5). The expected unmasking of global warming caused by aerosol reductions will require more aggressive greenhouse gas mitigation policies than anticipated in order to meet desired climate targets.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the many developments in estimates of the direct and indirect global annual mean radiative forcing due to present-day concentrations of anthropogenic tropospheric aerosols since Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [1996]. The range of estimates of the global mean direct radiative forcing due to six distinct aerosol types is presented. Additionally, the indirect effect is split into two components corresponding to the radiative forcing due to modification of the radiative properties of clouds (cloud albedo effect) and the effects of anthropogenic aerosols upon the lifetime of clouds (cloud lifetime effect). The radiative forcing for anthropogenic sulphate aerosol ranges from −0.26 to −0.82 W m−2. For fossil fuel black carbon the radiative forcing ranges from +0.16 W m−2 for an external mixture to +0.42 W m−2 for where the black carbon is modeled as internally mixed with sulphate aerosol. For fossil fuel organic carbon the two estimates of the likely weakest limit of the direct radiative forcing are −0.02 and −0.04 W m−2. For biomass-burning sources of black carbon and organic carbon the combined radiative forcing ranges from −0.14 to −0.74 W m−2. Estimates of the radiative forcing due to mineral dust vary widely from +0.09 to −0.46 W m−2; even the sign of the radiative forcing is not well established due to the competing effects of solar and terrestrial radiative forcings. A single study provides a very tentative estimate of the radiative forcing of nitrates to be −0.03 W m−2. Estimates of the cloud albedo indirect radiative forcing range from −0.3 to approximately −1.8 W m−2. Although the cloud lifetime effect is identified as a potentially important climate forcing mechanism, it is difficult to quantify in the context of the present definition of radiative forcing of climate change and current model simulations. This is because its estimation by general circulation models necessarily includes some level of cloud and water vapor feedbacks, which affect the hydrological cycle and the dynamics of the atmosphere. Available models predict that the radiative flux perturbation associated with the cloud lifetime effect is of a magnitude similar to that of the cloud albedo effect.},

	abstract = {We evaluate, using a box model, the sensitivity of direct climate forcing by atmospheric aerosols for a “global mean” aerosol that consists of fine and coarse modes to aerosol composition, aerosol size distribution, relative humidity (RH), aerosol mixing state (internal versus external mixture), deliquescence/crystallization hysteresis, and solar zenith angle. We also examine the dependence of aerosol upscatter fraction on aerosol size, solar zenith angle, and wavelength and the dependence of single scatter albedo on wavelength and aerosol composition. The single most important parameter in determining direct aerosol forcing is relative humidity, and the most important process is the increase of the aerosol mass as a result of water uptake. An increase of the relative humidity from 40 to 80\% is estimated for the global mean aerosol considered to result in an increase of the radiative forcing by a factor of 2.1. Forcing is relatively insensitive to the fine mode diameter increase due to hygroscopic growth, as long as this mode remains inside the efficient scattering size region. The hysteresis/deliquescence region introduces additional uncertainty but, in general, errors less than 20\% result by the use of the average of the two curves to predict forcing. For fine aerosol mode mean diameters in the 0.2–0.5 μm range direct aerosol forcing is relatively insensitive (errors less than 20\%) to variations of the mean diameter. Estimation of the coarse mode diameter within a factor of 2 is generally sufficient for the estimation of the total aerosol radiative forcing within 20\%. Moreover, the coarse mode, which represents the nonanthropogenic fraction of the aerosol, is estimated to contribute less than 10\% of the total radiative forcing for all RHs of interest. Aerosol chemical composition is important to direct radiative forcing as it determines (1) water uptake with RH, and (2) optical properties. The effect of absorption by aerosol components on forcing is found to be significant even for single scatter albedo values of ω=0.93–0.97. The absorbing aerosol component reduces the aerosol forcing from that in its absence by roughly 30\% at 60\% RH and 20\% at 90\% RH. The mixing state of the aerosol (internal versus external) for the particular aerosol considered here is found to be of secondary importance. While sulfate mass scattering efficiency (m2 (g SO42−)−1) and the normalized sulfate forcing (W (g SO42−)−1) increase strongly with RH, total mass scattering efficiency (m2 g−1) and normalized forcing (W g−1) are relatively insensitive to RH, wherein the mass of all species, including water, are accounted for. Following S. Nemesure et al. (Direct shortwave forcing of climate by anthropogenic sulfate aerosol: sensitivity to particle size, composition, and relative humidity, submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research, 1995), we find that aerosol feeing achieves a maximum at a particular solar zenith angle, reflecting a balance between increasing upscatter fraction with increasing solar zenith angle and decreasing solar flux (from Rayleigh scattering) with increasing solar zenith angle.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic sulfur compounds play an important role in acid deposition, aerosol particle formation, and subsequent radiative forcing and human fine particulate exposure. There are substantial uncertainties in processes influencing sulfate and precursor distributions, however, that have not yet been resolved through comparisons with observations. We find here an underappreciated factor that has a large impact on model results: uncertain emission height. Global aerosol-climate model simulations indicate that the assumed effective anthropogenic emission height is very important to SO2 near-surface concentrations and vertical profile. The global range of near-surface SO2 concentration over land (ocean) due to uncertainty in industrial (international shipping) emission injection height is 81\% (76\%), relative to the average concentration. This sensitivity is much larger than the uncertainty of SO2 emission rates. Black carbon and primary organic matter concentration and profiles are also sensitive to emission heights (53\% over land and 28\% over oceans). The impact of emission height uncertainty is larger in winter for land-based emissions, but larger in summer over the Northern Hemisphere ocean for shipping emissions. The variation in aerosol optical depth related to shipping emission injection heights is 11\% over oceans, revealing the potential importance of injection height on aerosol forcing and climatic effects. The large impact on SO2 concentrations can confound attempts to use surface, aircraft, and satellite observations to constrain the importance of other processes that govern sulfur compound distributions in the atmosphere. The influence of emission height on vertical SO2 column also will impact the accuracy of satellite retrievals.},

Aerosol growth was measured by comparison of differential mobility analyzer size distributions before and after each 3–4 min cloud cycle. Predictions of aerosol growth were then made with a full microphysical cloud model used to simulate each individual experimental cloud cycle. Model results of the H2O2 oxidation experiments best fit the experimental data using the third-order rate constant of Maass et al. [1999] (k = 9.1 × 107 M−2 s−1), with relative aerosol growth agreeing within 3\% of measured values, while the rate of Hoffmann and Colvert [1985] produced agreement within 4–9\%, and the rate of Martin and Damschen [1981] only within 13–18\%. Simulation results of aerosol growth during the O3 oxidation experiments were 60–80\% less than the measured values, confirming previous results [Hoppel et al., 1994b]. Experimental results and analyses presented here show that the SO2 - O3 rate constants would have to be more than 5 times larger than currently accepted values to explain the measured growth. However, unmeasured NH3 contamination present in trace amounts ({\textless}0.2 ppb) could explain the disagreement, but this is speculative and the source of this discrepancy is still unknown.},

Among the latter, formic acid facilitates the nucleation of cloud droplets4 and contributes to the acidity of clouds and rainwater1,5. At present, chemistry–climate models greatly underestimate the atmospheric burden of formic acid, because key processes related to its sources and sinks remain poorly understood2,6–9. Here we present atmospheric chamber experiments that show that formaldehyde is efficiently converted to gaseous formic acid via a multiphase pathway that involves its hydrated form, methanediol. In warm cloud droplets, methanediol undergoes fast outgassing but slow dehydration. Using a chemistry–climate model, we estimate that the gas-phase oxidation of methanediol produces up to four times more formic acid than all other known chemical sources combined. Our findings reconcile model predictions and measurements of formic acid abundance. The additional formic acid burden increases atmospheric acidity by reducing the pH of clouds and rainwater by up to 0.3. The diol mechanism presented here probably applies to other aldehydes and may help to explain the high atmospheric levels of other organic acids that affect aerosol growth and cloud evolution.},

	abstract = {Diverse chemical pathways in the troposphere convert sulphur and nitrogen oxides and organic compounds into acids, involving the gas phase, the liquid phase (cloud, fog and rain water) and, possibly, certain suspended aerosols. The rates of acid generation are critically affected by the extent of generation of the oxidizing species and the kinetics of the reactions. Precipitation in the eastern United States shows a strong seasonal variation in deposition of sulphates in contrast to nitrates. Computer simulations can now rationalize the observed seasonal trends. Recent tropospheric measurements of gaseous hydrogen peroxide show that this gas is a major oxidant leading to sulphuric acid generation in cloud water.},

	abstract = {A simplified theoretical model is proposed for evaluating the dynamic behavior of photochemically generated aerosols in the SO2—air system. The key simplifying assumption is that evaporation rates are negligible compared with condensation rates for molecular clusters and particles of all sizes. The theory accounts for the formation of condensable molecules (monomer) by chemical reaction, and coagulation of these monomer with clusters of condensed molecules to form larger particles. Cluster coagulation is also included. For a constant rate of monomer production, the equations can be cast in a dimensionless form which is independent of the rate of monomer formation by chemical reaction. These dimensionless equations have been solved numerically, both including and neglecting the effect of London—van der Waals forces on the coagulation rate. Agreement between theory and the data ofW. E. Clark (“Measurements of Aerosols Produced by the Photochemical Oxidation of SO2 in Air,” Ph.D. thesis, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, 1972) and G. Madelaine, M. Perrin, and A. Renoux (J. Aerosol Sci. 12, 202 (1979)) is good, particularly when London—van der Waals forces are considered. Because the solutions are presented in dimensionless form, direct application of these results for arbitrary rates of aerosol formation and for aerosols with arbitrary physical properties is possible.},

Subsequent addition of NH3 led to further chemical conversion, the product being identified as (NH4)2SO4 by X-ray diffraction. Mass spectrometric studies of the gas phase showed the expected reaction sequence leading to the formation of H3O+ hydrates, and the hydroxyl radical. Additional experiments with an ion trap and appropriate free radical scavengers proved that aerosol formation did not involve an ion-molecule switching reaction; but, rather, the reaction of OH with SO2 was found to be an important initiating step.},

	abstract = {Satellite instruments have been providing measurements of global volcanic emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) since 1978, based on observations in the ultraviolet (UV), infrared (IR) and microwave spectral bands. We review recent advances in satellite remote sensing of volcanic gases, focusing on increased instrument sensitivity to tropospheric SO2 emissions and techniques to determine volcanic plume altitude. A synthesis of {\textasciitilde}36 years of global UV, IR and microwave satellite measurements yields an updated assessment of the volcanic SO2 ﬂux to the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) between 1978 and 2014 ({\textasciitilde}1–2 Tg/yr). The present availability of multiple UV and IR satellite SO2 products provides increased conﬁdence in calculated SO2 loadings for many eruptions. We examine the temporal and latitudinal distribution of volcanic SO2 emissions and reassess the relationship between eruptive SO2 discharge and eruption magnitude, ﬁnding a ﬁrst-order correlation between SO2 emission and volcanic explosivity index (VEI), but with signiﬁcant scatter. Based on the observed SO2-VEI relation, we estimate the fraction of eruptive SO2 emissions released by the smallest eruptions ({\textasciitilde} 0.48 Tg/yr), which is not recorded by satellite observations. A detailed breakdown of the sources of measured SO2 emissions reveals intuitively expected correlations between eruption frequency, SO2 loading and volcanic degassing style. We discuss new constraints on e-folding times for SO2 removal in volcanic plumes, and highlight recent measurements of volcanic hydrogen chloride (HCl) injections into the UTLS. An analysis of passive volcanic emissions of SO2 detected in Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) SO2 data since 2004 provides new insight into the location and stability of the dominant sources of volcanic SO2 over the past decade. Since volcanic SO2 emissions constitute a random, highly variable perturbation to the atmosphere-climate system, continued monitoring of volcanic SO2 emissions from space by multiple UV and IR instruments to extend the current multi-decadal record is essential, and near-global, geostationary measurements of SO2 may be available by the end of the current decade.},

	abstract = {This dataset is associated with the VolcanEESM project led by the project team at the University of Leeds. The project was funded by NCAR/UCAR Atmospheric Chemistry and Modeling Visiting Scientist Program, NCAS, University of Leeds.

The global volcanic sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions database is a combination of available information from the wider literature with as many observations of the amount and location of SO2 emitted by each volcanic eruption as possible. The database includes no information about the size, mass, distribution or optical depth of resulting aerosol. As such the database is model agnostic and it is up to each modeling group to make decisions about how to implement the emission file in their prognostic stratospheric aerosol scheme.

The dataset is divided into two parts based on the availability of satellite data. For the pre-satellite era, the necessary information about the emissions was gathered from the latest ice core records of sulphate deposition in combination historical accounts available in the wider literature (see references included in the database for specific citation for each record). In the satellite era, volcanic emissions were primarily derived from remotely sensed observations.

For the period 1850 CE to 1979 the dataset combined the most recent volcanic sulfate deposition datasets from ice cores with volcanological and, where applicable, petrological estimates of the SO2 mass emitted as well as historical records of large-magnitude volcanic eruptions. In detail, for the majority of eruptions between 1850 CE to 1979 , there are few direct measurement of SO2 emissions or quantitative observations of the plume height and very few measurements of the aerosol optical depth (AOD).

Parameters in the database include:
Day\_of\_Emission: The 24 hour period in which the emission is thought to have occurred. (Ordered by the variable Eruption\_Number starting with the first eruption in the database.)

Eruption: Field that contains the Volcano\_Number (Which uniquely identifies each volcano in the Global Volcanism Program Database), Volcano\_Name (official name from the Global Volcanism Program Database), Notes\_and\_References (list of notes about the observed parameters and references used to derive each entry).

Latitude: Latitude of each emission from -90 to +90 (Ordered by the variable Eruption\_Number starting with the first eruption in the database.)

Longitude: Longitude of each emission degrees East (Ordered by the variable Eruption\_Number starting with the first eruption in the database.)

VEI: Volcanic Explosively Index of each emission based on Global Volcanism Program Database (Ordered by the variable Eruption\_Number starting with the first eruption in the database.)

Total\_Emission\_of\_SO2\_Tg: Total emission of SO2 in teragram for the specific database entry (Ordered by the variable Eruption\_Number starting with the first eruption in the database.)

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} New particle formation (NPF), which generates nucleation mode aerosol, was observed in the tropical Upper Troposphere (UT) and Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL) by in situ airborne measurements over South America (January–March 2005), Australia (November–December 2005), West Africa (August 2006) and Central America (2004–2007). Particularly intense NPF was found at the bottom of the TTL. Measurements with a set of condensation particle counters (CPCs) with different \textit{d}$_{\textrm{p50}}$ (50\% lower size detection efficiency diameter or "cut-off diameter") were conducted on board the M-55 \textit{Geophysica} in the altitude range of 12.0–20.5 km and on board the DLR \textit{Falcon}-20 at up to 11.5 km altitude. On board the NASA WB-57F size distributions were measured over Central America in the 4 to 1000 nm diameter range with a system of nucleation mode aerosol spectrometers. Nucleation mode particle concentrations (\textit{N}$_{\textrm{NM}}$) were derived from these measurements which allow for identifying many NPF events with \textit{N}$_{\textrm{NM}}$ in the range of thousands of particles per cm$^{\textrm{3}}$. Over Australia and West Africa, we identified NPF in the outflow of tropical convection, in particular of a Mesoscale Convective System (MCS). Newly formed particles with \textit{N}$_{\textrm{NM}}$ {\textgreater} 1000 cm$^{\textrm{−3}}$ were found to coexist with ice cloud particles (\textit{d}$_{\textrm{p}}$ {\textgreater} 2 μm) as long as cloud particle concentrations remained below 2 cm$^{\textrm{−3}}$. The occurrence of NPF within the upper troposphere and the TTL was generally confined within 340 K to 380 K potential temperature, but NPF was of particular strength between 350 K and 370 K (i.e. {\textasciitilde}1–4 km below the cold point tropopause). Analyses of the aerosol volatility (at 250 °C) show that in the TTL on average 75–90\% of the particles were volatile, compared to typically only 50\% in the extra-tropical UT, indicative for the particles to mainly consist of H$_{\textrm{2}}$SO$_{\textrm{4}}$-H$_{\textrm{2}}$O and possibly organic compounds. Along two flight segments over Central and South America (24 February 2005 and 7 August 2006, at 12.5 km altitude) in cloud free air, above thin cirrus, particularly high \textit{N}$_{\textrm{NM}}$ were observed. Recent lifting had influenced the probed air masses, and \textit{N}$_{\textrm{NM}}$ reached up to 16 000 particles cm$^{\textrm{−3}}$ (ambient concentration). A sensitivity study using an aerosol model, which includes neutral and ion induced nucleation processes, simulates \textit{N}$_{\textrm{NM}}$ in reasonable agreement with the in situ observations of clear-air NPF. Based on new, stringent multi-CPC criteria, our measurements corroborate the hypothesis that the tropical UT and the TTL are regions supplying freshly nucleated particles. Our findings narrow the altitude of the main source region to the bottom TTL, i.e. to the level of main tropical convection outflow, and, by means of measurements of carbon monoxide, they indicate the importance of anthropogenic emissions in NPF. After growth and/or coalescence the nucleation mode particles may act as cloud condensation nuclei in the tropical UT, or, upon ascent into the stratosphere, contribute to maintain the stratospheric background aerosol.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In this paper we present parameterized equations for calculation of sulfuric acid–water critical nucleus compositions, critical cluster radii and homogeneous nucleation rates for tropospheric and stratospheric conditions. The parameterizations are based on a classical nucleation model. We used an improved model for the hydrate formation relying on ab initio calculations of small sulfuric acid clusters and on experimental data for vapor pressures and equilibrium constants for hydrate formation. The most rigorous nucleation kinetics and the thermodynamically consistent version of the classical binary homogeneous nucleation theory were used. The parameterized nucleation rates are compared with experimental ones, and at room temperature and relative humidities above 30\% they are within experimental error. At lower temperatures and lower humidities the agreement is somewhat poorer. Overall, the values of nucleation rates are increased compared to a previous parameterization and are within an order of magnitude compared with theoretical values for all conditions studied. The parameterized equations will reduce the computing time by a factor 1/500 compared to nonparameterized nucleation rate calculations and therefore are in particular useful for large-scale models. The parameterized formulas are valid at temperatures between 230.15 K and 305.15 K, relative humidities between 0.01\% and 100\%, and sulfuric acid concentrations from 104 to 1011 cm−3. They can be used to extrapolate the classical results down to 190 K. The parametrization is limited to cases where nucleation rates are between 10−7 and 1010 cm−3s−1, and the critical cluster contains at least four molecules.},

Icelandic v-dust was chosen as a case study due to frequency of volcanic eruptions and high aeolian activity in the area. In this study, we focus on the kinetics and mechanism of the reaction of sulfur dioxide (SO2) with natural v-dust samples under atmospheric conditions using coated wall ﬂow tube reactor and diﬀuse reﬂectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). Steady state uptake coeﬃcients determined are in the range of 10−9 to 10−8 depending on the considered v-dust. Concomitantly with SO2 uptake, both sulﬁtes and sulfates are monitored on the surface of v-dust, with sulfates being the ﬁnal oxidation product, attesting of SO2 surface reaction. Surface hydroxyl groups play a crucial role in the conversion of SO2 to sulﬁtes as evidenced from both ﬂow tube and DRIFTS experiments. Based on these experimental results, a mechanism for SO2 interaction with diﬀerent surface sites of v-dust is proposed and discussed. This study provides original insights in the kinetics of SO2 uptake under simulated atmospheric conditions and its mechanism and transformation on volcanic material. To that regards, it brings an accurate perspective on SO2 heterogeneous sinks in the atmosphere.},

We analyze the HadCRUT4 observational data set which has the most comprehensive set of adjustments available to date for systematic biases in sea surface temperatures and the CMIP5 ensemble of coupled models which represents the most sophisticated multi‒model climate modeling exercise yet carried out. Simulations that incorporate both anthropogenic and natural factors span changes in observed temperatures between 1860 and 2010, while simulations of natural factors do not warm as much as observed. As a result of sampling a much wider range of structural modeling uncertainty, we find a wider spread of historic temperature changes in CMIP5 than was simulated by the previous multi‒model ensemble, CMIP3. However, calculations of attributable temperature trends based on optimal detection support previous conclusions that human‒induced greenhouse gases dominate observed global warming since the mid‒20th century. With a much wider exploration of model uncertainty than previously carried out, we find that individually the models give a wide range of possible counteracting cooling from the direct and indirect effects of aerosols and other non‒greenhouse gas anthropogenic forcings. Analyzing the multi‒model mean over 1951–2010 (focusing on the most robust result), we estimate a range of possible contributions to the observed warming of approximately 0.6 K from greenhouse gases of between 0.6 and 1.2 K, balanced by a counteracting cooling from other anthropogenic forcings of between 0 and −0.5 K.},

Transport processes occurring on smaller space and time scales are parameterized as eddy diffusion except for transport in deep convective clouds which is treated separately. The simulations are broadly consistent with observations of concentrations in air and precipitation in and over polluted regions in Europe and North America.

Subaerial volcanic SO2 emissions indicate a 13 Tg/a SO2 time-averaged flux, based upon an early 1970s to 1997 time frame. When considering other S species present in volcanic emissions, a time-averaged inventory of subaerial volcanic S fluxes is 10.4 Tg/a S. These time-averaged fluxes are conservative minimum fluxes since they rely upon actual measurements. The temporal, spatial, and chemical inhomogeneities inherent to this system gave higher S fluxes in specific years.

	abstract = {AbstractBalloon-borne stratospheric condensation nuclei (CN) measurements have been made from McMurdo Station, Antarctica (78°S), 1986–2010, and from Laramie, Wyoming (41°N), 1982 to the present. In the Antarctic region, the measurements show the formation of a layer of enhanced concentrations of stratospheric CN, between 21 and 27 km, around mid August, reaching its maximum extent between September and early October. CN concentrations increase from backgrounds of 10–20 cm−3 to over 100 cm−3 in the layer. In the northern midlatitudes, the measurements show a quasi-annual and smaller layer of enhanced CN concentrations between 25 and 31 km in late winter and early spring. In the quasi-annual layers, CN concentrations increase from backgrounds of 1–10 cm−3 to over 20 cm−3. Volcanic eruptions appear to enhance the CN layers observed over Laramie and McMurdo. The Arctic Oscillation generally correlates with the magnitude of the Laramie CN layer, suggesting the importance of meridional transport. Volatility measurements and nucleation modeling support a sulfuric acid and water composition and binary homogeneous nucleation as the likely CN formation mechanism in both locations. Bimonthly measurements above Laramie support coagulation as the main reason for the dissipation of the CN layer. Air parcel trajectory modeling confirms that the CN layer forms locally to McMurdo and that it is related to solar exposure, while above Laramie trajectory analysis indicates that Arctic conditions and ambient temperature changes during northerly transport impact the magnitude of the CN layer above Laramie.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Using a three-dimensional general circulation model with sulfur chemistry and sectional aerosol microphysics (WACCM/CARMA), we studied aerosol formation and microphysics in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) as well as the middle and upper stratosphere based on three nucleation schemes (two binary homogeneous schemes and an ion-mediated scheme related to one of the binary schemes). Simulations suggest that ion-mediated nucleation rates in the UTLS are 25 \% higher than its related binary scheme, but that the rates predicted by the two binary schemes vary by two orders of magnitude. None of the nucleation schemes is superior at matching the limited observations available at the smallest sizes. However, it is found that coagulation, not nucleation, controls number concentration at sizes greater than approximately 10 nm. Therefore, based on this study, processes relevant to atmospheric chemistry and radiative forcing in the UTLS are not sensitive to the choice of nucleation schemes. The dominance of coagulation over other microphysical processes in the UTLS is consistent with other recent work using microphysical models. Simulations using all three nucleation schemes compare reasonably well to observations of size distributions, number concentration across latitude, and vertical profiles of particle mixing ratio in the UTLS. Interestingly, we find that we need to include Van der Waals forces in our coagulation scheme to match the UTLS aerosol concentrations. We conclude that this model can reasonably represent sulfate microphysical processes in the UTLS, and that the properties of particles at atmospherically relevant sizes appear to be insensitive to the details of the nucleation scheme. We also suggest that micrometeorites, which are not included in this model, dominate the aerosol properties in the upper stratosphere above about 30 km.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In general, trends in sulphate are small, and the data sets are not of sufﬁcient length to determine the direction of trend with conﬁdence. Since relatively short periods of high or low concentration near to the start or ﬁnish of the period have a disproportionate inﬂuence, the choice of period over which the trend is calculated is crucial to the outcome. All six sites showed a signiﬁcant reducing trend in sulphur dioxide, while ammonia data appear to be affected by sampling problems and site relocations and clear trends are not apparent. Data relating annual mean airborne concentrations of sulphur dioxide and sulphate from several countries can be related through a relationship of the form: c [SO42À] ¼ a\$c [SO2]b þ c in which a, b and c are constants and c represents concentrations. While constant b remains the same for different countries, a and c can change in ways that appear to relate to either the distance from major SO2 sources, or the oxidising capacity of the atmosphere. Using the relationship between SO42À and SO2 derived from UK sites allows estimation of the reduction in sulphur dioxide emissions affecting UK sites needed to reduce sulphate concentrations by 1 mg mÀ3. This is 55\% and 49\% for Harwell and North Kensington respectively.},

Five ensemble members are run for each of five aerosol scaling factors. Decadal variations in surface temperatures are strongly sensitive to aerosol forcing, particularly between 1950 and 1980. Post-1980, trends are dominated by greenhouse gas forcing, with much lower sensitivity to aerosol emission differences. Most realizations with aerosol forcing more negative than about –1 Wm–2 simulate stronger cooling trends in the mid-20th century compared with observations, while the simulated warming post-1980 always exceeds observed warming, likelydue to a warm bias in the transient climate response in HadGEM3-GC3.1.},

SMILEs allow scientists to quantify and separate the internal variability of the climate system and its response to external forcing, with different types of SMILEs appropriate to answer different scientiﬁc questions. In this editorial we ﬁrst provide an introduction to SMILEs and an overview of the studies in the special issue “Large Ensemble Climate Model Simulations: Exploring Natural Variability, Change Signals and Impacts”. These studies analyse a range of different types of SMILEs including global climate models (GCMs), regionally downscaled climate models (RCMs), a hydrological model with input from a RCM SMILE, a SMILE with prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) built for event attribution, a SMILE that assimilates observed data, and an initialised regional model. These studies provide novel methods, that can be used with SMILEs. The methods published in this issue include a snapshot empirical orthogonal function analysis used to investigate El Niño–Southern Oscillation teleconnections; the partitioning of future uncertainty into model differences, internal variability, and scenario choices; a weighting scheme for multi-model ensembles that can incorporate SMILEs; and a method to identify the required ensemble size for any given problem. Studies in this special issue also focus on RCM SMILEs, with projections of the North Atlantic Oscillation and its regional impacts assessed over Europe, and an RCM SMILE intercomparison. Finally a subset of studies investigate projected impacts of global warming, with increased water ﬂows projected for future hydrometeorological events in southern Ontario; precipitation projections over central Europe are investigated and found to be inconsistent across models in the Alps, with a continuation of past tendencies in Mid-Europe; and equatorial Asia is found to have an increase in the probability of large ﬁre and drought events under higher levels of warming. These studies demonstrate the utility of different types of SMILEs. In the second part of this editorial we provide a perspective on how three types of SMILEs could be combined to exploit the advantages of each. To do so we use a GCM SMILE and an RCM SMILE with all forcings, as well as a naturally forced GCM SMILE (nat-GCM) over the European domain. We utilise one of the key advantages of SMILEs, precisely separating the forced response and internal variability within an individual model to investigate a variety of simple questions. Broadly we show that the GCM can be used to investigate broad-scale patterns and can be directly compared to the nat-GCM to attribute forced changes to either anthropogenic emissions or volcanoes. The RCM provides high-resolution spatial information of both the forced change and the internal variability around this change at different warming levels. By combining all three ensembles we can gain information that would not be available using a single type of SMILE alone, providing a perspective on future research that could be undertaken using these tools.},

A cloud brightening on the month-tomonth scale due to variability in the background aerosol is found to dominate even in the cases where anthropogenic aerosols are added. The aerosol composition is of importance for this cloud brightening, that is thereby region dependent. There is indication that absorbing aerosols to some extent counteract the cloud brightening but scene darkening with increasing aerosol burden is generally not supported, even in regions where absorbing aerosols dominate. Month-to-month cloud albedo variability also conﬁrms the importance of liquid water content for cloud albedo. Regional, monthly mean cloud albedo is found to increase with the addition of anthropogenic aerosols and more so with sulfate than non-sulfate. Changes in cloud albedo between experiments are related to changes in cloud water content as well as droplet size distribution changes, so that models with large increases in liquid water path and/or cloud droplet number show large cloud albedo increases with increasing aerosol. However, no clear relation between model sensitivities to aerosol variations on the month-to-month scale and changes in cloud albedo due to changed aerosol burden is found.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Anthropogenic aerosol emissions have increased considerably over the last century, but climate effects and quantification of the emissions are highly uncertain as one goes back in time.
This uncertainty is partly due to a lack of observations in the pre-satellite era, making the observations we do have before 1990 additionally valuable.
Aerosols suspended in the atmosphere scatter and absorb incoming solar radiation and thereby alter the Earth's surface energy balance. Previous studies show that Earth system models (ESMs) do not adequately represent surface energy fluxes over the historical era.
We investigated global and regional aerosol effects over the time period 1961–2014 by looking at surface downwelling shortwave radiation (SDSR).
We used observations from ground stations as well as multiple experiments from eight ESMs participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Version 6 (CMIP6).
Our results show that this subset of models reproduces the observed transient SDSR well in Europe but poorly in China. We suggest that this may be attributed to missing emissions of sulfur dioxide in China, sulfur dioxide being a precursor to sulfate, which is a highly reflective aerosol and responsible for more reflective clouds.
The emissions of sulfur dioxide used in the models do not show a temporal pattern that could explain observed SDSR evolution over China.
The results from various aerosol emission perturbation experiments from DAMIP, RFMIP and AerChemMIP show that only simulations containing anthropogenic aerosol emissions show dimming, even if the dimming is underestimated.
Simulated clear-sky and all-sky SDSR do not differ greatly, suggesting that cloud cover changes are not a dominant cause of the biased SDSR evolution in the simulations. Therefore we suggest that the discrepancy between modeled and observed SDSR evolution is partly caused by erroneous aerosol and aerosol precursor emission inventories. This is an important finding as it may help interpret whether ESMs reproduce the historical climate evolution for the right or wrong reason.},

	abstract = {The Earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) to a doubling of atmospheric CO2, along with the transient climate response (TCR) and greenhouse gas emissions pathways, determines the amount of future warming. Coupled climate models have in the past been important tools to estimate and understand ECS. ECS estimated from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models lies between 2.0 and 4.7 K (mean of 3.2 K), whereas in the latest CMIP6 the spread has increased to 1.8–5.5 K (mean of 3.7 K), with 5 out of 25 models exceeding 5 K. It is thus pertinent to understand the causes underlying this shift. Here we compare the CMIP5 and CMIP6 model ensembles and ﬁnd a systematic shift between CMIP eras to be unexplained as a process of random sampling from modeled forcing and feedback distributions. Instead, shortwave feedbacks shift towards more positive values, in particular over the Southern Ocean, driving the shift towards larger ECS values in many of the models. These results suggest that changes in model treatment of mixed-phase cloud processes and changes to Antarctic sea ice representation are likely causes of the shift towards larger ECS. Somewhat surprisingly, CMIP6 models exhibit less historical warming than CMIP5 models, despite an increase in TCR between CMIP eras (mean TCR increased from 1.7 to 1.9 K). The evolution of the warming suggests, however, that several of the CMIP6 models apply too strong aerosol cooling, resulting in too weak mid-20th century warming compared to the instrumental record.},

Over the past centuries, aerosols, via their ability to absorb or scatter solar radiation and alter clouds, played an important role in counterbalancing some of the greenhouse gas (GHG) caused global warming. The multicentury anthropogenic aerosol cooling effect prevented present‐day climate from reaching even higher surface air temperatures and subsequent more dramatic climate impacts. Trends in aerosol concentrations and optical depth show that in many polluted regions such as Europe and the United States, aerosol precursor emissions decreased back to levels of the 1950s. More recent polluting countries such as China may have reached a turning point in recent years as well, while India still follows an upward trend. Here we study aerosol trends in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) simulations of the GISS ModelE2.1 climate model using a fully coupled atmosphere composition conﬁguration, including interactive gas‐phase chemistry and either an aerosol microphysical (MATRIX) or a mass‐based (One‐Moment Aerosol, OMA) aerosol module. Results show that whether global aerosol radiative forcing is already declining depends on the aerosol scheme used. Using the aerosol microphysical scheme, where the aerosol system reacts more strongly to the trend in sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, global peak direct aerosol forcing was reached in the 1980s, whereas the mass‐based scheme simulates peak direct aerosol forcing around 2010.},

We combine new model results with a historical and educational perspective to organize existing ideas around feedbacks and linear models. Our results suggest that the state- and forcing-dependency of feedbacks are probably not appreciated enough, and not considered appropriately in many studies. A non-constant feedback parameter likely explains some of the differences in estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity from different methods and types of data.

The net radiative feedback is found to be more amplifying (higher effective climate sensitivity) for aerosol than GHG forcing, and hence also less amplifying for net historical (GHG + aerosol) than GHG only. We demonstrate that this difference is consistent with their different latitudinal distributions. Historical aerosol forcing is most pronounced in northern extratropics, where the boundary layer is decoupled from the free troposphere, so the consequent temperature change is confined to low altitude and causes low-level cloud changes. This is caused by change in stability, which also affects upper-tropospheric clear-sky emission, affecting both shortwave and longwave radiative feedbacks. This response is a feature of extratropical forcing generally, regardless of its sign or hemisphere.},

Production and removal mechanisms of sulfate are analyzed for the conditions of natural and anthropogenic sulfur emissions. Results show that the 1985 anthropogenic emission tripled the global SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ and sulfate loadings from its natural value of 0.16 and 0.10 Tg S, respectively. Under natural conditions, the fraction of sulfate produced in-cloud is 74\%; whereas with anthropogenic emissions, the fraction of in-cloud sulfate production slightly increased to 76\%. Lifetimes of SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ and sulfate under polluted conditions are estimated to be 1.7 and 2.0 days, respectively. The tripling of sulfate results in a direct radiative forcing of \&minus;0.43 W m$^{\textrm{\&minus;2}}$ (clear-sky) or \&minus;0.24 W m$^{\textrm{\&minus;2}}$ (all-sky), and a significant first indirect forcing of \&minus;1.85 W m$^{\textrm{\&minus;2}}$, leading to a mean global cooling of about 0.1 K. Regional forcing and responses are significantly stronger than the global values. The first indirect forcing is sensitive to the relationship between aerosol concentration and cloud droplet number concentration which requires further investigation. Two aspects of chemistry-climate interaction are addressed. Firstly, the coupling effects lead to a slight decrease of 1\% in global sulfate loading for both the cases of natural and anthropogenic added sulfur emissions. Secondly, only the indirect effect of sulfate aerosols yields significantly stronger signals in changes of near surface temperature and sulfate loading than changes due to intrinsic climate variability, while other responses to the indirect effect and all responses to the direct effect are below noise level.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This uncertainty affects our ability to estimate how sensitive the climate is to greenhouse gas emissions. Here we perform a sensitivity analysis on a global model to quantify the uncertainty in cloud radiative forcing over the industrial period caused by uncertainties in aerosol emissions and processes. Our results show that 45 per cent of the variance of aerosol forcing since about 1750 arises from uncertainties in natural emissions of volcanic sulphur dioxide, marine dimethylsulphide, biogenic volatile organic carbon, biomass burning and sea spray. Only 34 per cent of the variance is associated with anthropogenic emissions. The results point to the importance of understanding pristine pre-industrial-like environments, with natural aerosols only, and suggest that improved measurements and evaluation of simulated aerosols in polluted present-day conditions will not necessarily result in commensurate reductions in the uncertainty of forcing estimates.},

The anomalous cooling is pronounced over the Northern Hemisphere (NH) midlatitudes, coinciding with the rapid growth of anthropogenic sulfur dioxide ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}SO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) emissions, the primary precursor of atmospheric sulfate aerosols. Structural uncertainties between ESMs have a larger impact on the anomalous cooling than internal variability. Historical simulations with and without anthropogenic aerosol emissions indicate that the anomalous cooling in the ESMs is attributed to the higher aerosol burden in these models. The aerosol forcing sensitivity, estimated as the outgoing shortwave radiation (OSR) response to aerosol concentration changes, cannot well explain the diversity of pothole cooling (PHC) biases in the ESMs. The relative contributions to aerosol forcing sensitivity from aerosol–radiation interactions (ARIs) and aerosol–cloud interactions (ACIs) can be estimated from CMIP6 simulations. We show that even when the aerosol forcing sensitivity is similar between ESMs, the relative contributions of ARI and ACI may be substantially different. The ACI accounts for between 64 \% and 87 \% of the aerosol forcing sensitivity in the models and is the main source of the aerosol forcing sensitivity differences between the ESMs. The ACI can be further decomposed into a cloud-amount term (which depends linearly on cloud fraction) and a cloud-albedo term (which is independent of cloud fraction, to the first order), with the cloud-amount term accounting for most of the inter-model differences.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Global simulations of tropospheric sulfur are performed in the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) general circulation model (GCM) and used to calculate anthropogenic sulfate direct radiative forcing. Prognostic species are in-cloud oxidant H2O2, dimethylsulfide (DMS), methanesulfonic acid (MSA), SO2 and sulfate. Compared with most previous models (except others with prognostic H2O2), this model has relatively high anthropogenic SO2 and sulfate burden. We show that this is due partly to the depletion of the prognostic H2O2 and that moist convection delivers significant levels of SO2 to the free troposphere in polluted regions. Model agreement with surface observations is not remarkably different from previous studies. Following some previous studies, we propose that an additional in-cloud or heterogeneous oxidant is likely to improve the simulation near the surface. Our DMS source is lower than sources in previous studies, and sulfur values in remote regions are generally lower than those observed. Because of the high flux of SO2 to the free troposphere and the relatively low natural source, our model indicates a larger global anthropogenic contribution to the sulfate burden (77\%) than was estimated by previous global models. Additional high-altitude observations of the sulfur species are needed for model validation and resolution of this issue. Direct radiative forcing calculations give an annual average anthropogenic sulfate forcing of −0.67 W/m2. We compare the radiative forcings due to online (hourly varying) versus offline (monthly average) sulfate and find little difference on a global average, but we do find differences as great as 10\% in some regions. Thus, for example, over some polluted continental regions the forcing due to offline sulfate exceeds that of online sulfate, while over some oceanic regions the online sulfate forcing is larger. We show that these patterns are probably related to the correlation between clouds and sulfate, with positive correlations occuring over some polluted continental regions and negative correlations over high-latitude oceanic regions.},

It involved: (i) design of a standard model experiment for the world wide web, (ii) 10 model simulations of the cycles of sulphur and 222Rn/210Pb conforming to the experimental design, (iii) assemblage of the best available observations of atmospheric SO=4, SO2 and MSA and (iv) a workshop in Halifax, Canada to analyze model performance and future model development needs. The analysis presented in this paper and two companion papers by Roelofs, and Lohmann and co-workers examines the variance between models and observations, discusses the sources of that variance and suggests ways to improve models. Variations between models in the export of SOx from Europe or North America are not sufficient to explain an order of magnitude variation in spatial distributions of SOx downwind in the northern hemisphere. On average, models predicted surface level seasonal mean SO=4 aerosol mixing ratios better (most within 20\%) than SO2 mixing ratios (over-prediction by factors of 2 or more). Results suggest that vertical mixing from the planetary boundary layer into the free troposphere in source regions is a major source of uncertainty in predicting the global distribution of SO=4 aerosols in climate models today. For improvement, it is essential that globally coordinated research efforts continue to address emissions of all atmospheric species that affect the distribution and optical properties of ambient aerosols in models and that a global network of observations be established that will ultimately produce a world aerosol chemistry climatology.},

A description is provided of the source of each component to this budget. The top-of-atmosphere shortwave and longwave flux of energy is constrained by satellite observations. Partitioning of the radiative energy throughout the atmosphere is achieved through the use of detailed radiation models for both the longwave and shortwave spectral regions. Spectral features of shortwave and longwave fluxes at both the top and surface of the earth's system are presented. The longwave radiative forcing of the climate system for both clear (125 W m−2) and cloudy (155 W m−2) conditions are discussed. The authors find that for the clear sky case the contribution due to water vapor to the total longwave radiative forcing is 75 W m−2, while for carbon dioxide it is 32 W m−2. Clouds alter these values, and the effects of clouds on both the longwave and shortwave budget are addressed. In particular, the shielding effect by clouds on absorption and emission by water vapor is as large as the direct cloud forcing. Because the net surface heat budget must balance, the radiative fluxes constrain the sum of the sensible and latent heat fluxes, which can also be estimated independently.},

The precise routes by which incoming energy is transferred from the surface and within the atmosphere and back out to space, however, are important features that characterize the current climate. This has been analyzed in the past by several groups over the years, based on combinations of numerical model simulations and direct observations of the Earth's climate system. The results are often presented in schematic form to show the main routes for the transfer of energy into, out of and within the climate system. Although relatively simple in concept, such diagrams convey a great deal of information about the climate system in a compact form. Such an approach has not so far been widely adopted in any systematic way for other planets of the Solar System, let alone beyond, although quite detailed climate models of several planets are now available, constrained by many new observations and measurements. Here we present an analysis of the global transfers of energy within the climate systems of a range of planets within the Solar System, including Mars, Titan, Venus and Jupiter, as modelled by relatively comprehensive radiative transfer and (in some cases) numerical circulation models. These results are presented in schematic form for comparison with the classical global energy budget analyses for the Earth, highlighting important similarities and differences. We also take the first steps towards extending this approach to other Solar System and extrasolar planets, including Mars, Venus, Titan, Jupiter and the ‘hot Jupiter’ exoplanet HD 189733b, presenting a synthesis of both previously published and new calculations for all of these planets.},

An atmospheric general circulation model, the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model 1 (CCM1) is used to drive algorithms pertinent to the air-sea exchange of DMS. The cloud and radiation package in the CCM1 provides estimates of the solar radiation impinging on the surface ocean, which is then related to the flux of DMS from the ocean to the atmosphere on the basis of the empirical data of Bates et al. (1987a). The computed DMS flux values vary globally from 0.5 to 5.5 μmol m−2 d−1. A globally integrated ocean-to-atmosphere flux of 15 Tg S yr−1 (as DMS) is computed. This value is probably a lower limit since there is no explicit simulation of global primary productivity presently in the model. The DMS flux is implicitly lower in chronically cloudy regions, such as the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone and in low-radiation regions such as the high-latitude winter hemispheres. To examine the global applicability of the solar radiation-DMS flux relationship, the DMS flux fields are scaled by the independently computed transfer velocity fields so as to obtain global maps of surface ocean DMS concentration at the resolution of the model. The computed surface ocean DMS concentrations vary from 2 to 150 nL L−1, with highest values predicted near equatorial regions and adjacent to summer hemisphere polar regions, areas with relatively low climatological wind speeds. The oceanic DMS concentrations computed here agree with the experimental data in those regions not impacted by high biological productivity. In those areas of relatively high oceanic productivity the solar radiation-DMS flux relationship underestimates the ocean-to-atmosphere DMS flux and the subsequently computed surface ocean DMS concentrations.},

Here we show that the massive 2014–2015 fissure eruption in Holuhraun, Iceland, reduced the size of liquid cloud droplets—consistent with expectations—but had no discernible effect on other cloud properties. The reduction in droplet size led to cloud brightening and global-mean radiative forcing of around −0.2 watts per square metre for September to October 2014. Changes in cloud amount or cloud liquid water path, however, were undetectable, indicating that these indirect effects, and cloud systems in general, are well buffered against aerosol changes. This result will reduce uncertainties in future climate projections, because we are now able to reject results from climate models with an excessive liquid-water-path response.},

Comparisons of observations of H2S, DMS, SO2, and SO4− in remote areas with the model estimates indicate that the global flux of H2S and DMS, taken together, amounts to at most a few tens of Tg S yr−1. The present man-made emissions Of SO2 (about 80 Tg S yr−1) can account for a dominant part of the SO2 and SO4− observed in the lower troposphere of the northern hemisphere. On the other hand, neither natural emissions of H2S and DMS at the surface nor man-made emissions of SO2 seem to be able to explain the relatively high values of SO2 observed in the middle and upper troposphere in both hemispheres. Our calculations indicate that a relatively long-lived precursor must be involved as a source for this SO2. The amount of SO2 produced by the oxidation of CS2 and OCS does not seem sufficiently high. Average residence times in the atmosphere for H2S, SO2, and SO4− have been estimated to about 1, 1.5, and 5 days, respectively. If only higher portions of the troposphere are considered, the residence times increase considerably.},

	abstract = {Data from nine stratocumulus clouds in the northeastern Pacific Ocean were analyzed to determine the effect of aerosol particles on cloud microphysical and radiative properties. Seven nighttime and two daytime cases were included. The number concentration of below-cloud aerosol particles ({\textgreater}0.10 μm diameter) was highly correlated with cloud droplet number concentration. Droplet number concentrations were typically about 75\% of particle number concentration in the range of particle concentrations studied (≤400 cm−3). Particle number was anticorrelated with droplet size and with liquid water content in drizzle-sized drops. Radiative impact also depends upon cloud liquid water content and geometric thickness. Although most variability in these macroscopic properties of the clouds could be attributed to variability in the large-scale environment, a weak anticorrelation between particle concentration and cloud geometric thickness was observed. Because of these variations, no correlation between calculated cloud optical thickness or albedo and particle concentration was detectable for the data set as a whole. For regions with comparable liquid water contents in an individual cloud, higher particle concentrations did correspond to increased cloud optical thickness. These results verify that higher particle concentrations do directly affect the microphysics of stratiform clouds. However, the constant liquid water path assumption usually invoked in the Twomey aerosol indirect effect may not be valid.},

Assuming the aerosol optical depth is nearly twice as great as for the 1982 El Chichon eruption, the model forecasts a dramatic but temporary break in recent global warming trends. The simulations indicate that Pinatubo occurred too late in the year to prevent 1991 from becoming one of the warmest years in instrumental records, but intense aerosol cooling is predicted to begin late in 1991 and to maximize late in 1992. The predicted cooling is sufficiently large that by mid 1992 it should even overwhelm global warming associated with an El Nino that appears to be developing, but the El Nino could shift the time of minimum global temperature into 1993. The model predicts a return to record warm levels in the later 1990s. We estimate the effect of the predicted global cooling on such practical matters as the severity of the coming Soviet winter and the dates of cherry blossoming next spring, and discuss caveats which must accompany these preliminary simulations.},

	abstract = {A new release of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model version 1.2 (MPI-ESM1.2) is presented. The development focused on correcting errors in and improving the physical processes representation, as well as improving the computational performance, versatility, and overall user friendliness. In addition to new radiation and aerosol parameterizations of the atmosphere, several relatively large, but partly compensating, coding errors in the model's cloud, convection, and turbulence parameterizations were corrected. The representation of land processes was refined by introducing a multilayer soil hydrology scheme, extending the land biogeochemistry to include the nitrogen cycle, replacing the soil and litter decomposition model and improving the representation of wildfires. The ocean biogeochemistry now represents cyanobacteria prognostically in order to capture the response of nitrogen fixation to changing climate conditions and further includes improved detritus settling and numerous other refinements. As something new, in addition to limiting drift and minimizing certain biases, the instrumental record warming was explicitly taken into account during the tuning process. To this end, a very high climate sensitivity of around 7 K caused by low-level clouds in the tropics as found in an intermediate model version was addressed, as it was not deemed possible to match observed warming otherwise. As a result, the model has a climate sensitivity to a doubling of CO2 over preindustrial conditions of 2.77 K, maintaining the previously identified highly nonlinear global mean response to increasing CO2 forcing, which nonetheless can be represented by a simple two-layer model.},

Particular attention is paid to the role of natural organics, sea salt, and mineral dust in determining the gross aerosol properties as well as the anthropogenic contribution to these properties and the associated direct and indirect radiative forcing. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} The aerosol module is extended from earlier versions that have been published, and includes life-cycling of sea salt, mineral dust, particulate sulphate, black carbon, and primary and secondary organics. The impacts of most of the numerous changes since previous versions are thoroughly explored by sensitivity experiments. The most important changes are: modified prognostic sea salt emissions; updated treatment of precipitation scavenging and gravitational settling; inclusion of biogenic primary organics and methane sulphonic acid (MSA) from oceans; almost doubled production of land-based biogenic secondary organic aerosols (SOA); and increased ratio of organic matter to organic carbon (OM/OC) for biomass burning aerosols from 1.4 to 2.6. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Compared with in situ measurements and remotely sensed data, the new treatments of sea salt and dust aerosols give smaller biases in near-surface mass concentrations and aerosol optical depth than in the earlier model version. The model biases for mass concentrations are approximately unchanged for sulphate and BC. The enhanced levels of modeled OM yield improved overall statistics, even though OM is still underestimated in Europe and overestimated in North America. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} The global anthropogenic aerosol direct radiative forcing (DRF) at the top of the atmosphere has changed from a small positive value to −0.08 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ in CAM4-Oslo. The sensitivity tests suggest that this change can be attributed to the new treatment of biomass burning aerosols and gravitational settling. Although it has not been a goal in this study, the new DRF estimate is closer both to the median model estimate from the AeroCom intercomparison and the best estimate in IPCC AR4. Estimated DRF at the ground surface has increased by ca. 60\%, to −1.89 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$. We show that this can be explained by new emission data and omitted mixing of constituents between updrafts and downdrafts in convective clouds. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} The increased abundance of natural OM and the introduction of a cloud droplet spectral dispersion formulation are the most important contributions to a considerably decreased estimate of the indirect radiative forcing (IndRF). The IndRF is also found to be sensitive to assumptions about the coating of insoluble aerosols by sulphate and OM. The IndRF of −1.2 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$, which is closer to the IPCC AR4 estimates than the previous estimate of −1.9 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$, has thus been obtained without imposing unrealistic artificial lower bounds on cloud droplet number concentrations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Abstract Through the latter half of the twentieth century, meridional shifts in tropical precipitation have been associated with severe droughts. Although linked to a variety of causes, the origin of these shifts remains elusive. Here, it is shown that they are unlikely to arise from internal variability of the climate system alone, as simulated by coupled ocean–atmosphere climate models. Similar to previous work, the authors find that anthropogenic and volcanic aerosols are the dominant drivers of simulated twentieth-century tropical precipitation shifts. Models that include the cloud-albedo and lifetime aerosol indirect effects yield significantly larger shifts than models that lack aerosol indirect effects and also reproduce most of the southward tropical precipitation shift in the Pacific. However, all models significantly underestimate the magnitude of the observed shifts in the Atlantic sector, unless driven by observed SSTs. Mechanistically, tropical precipitation shifts are driven by interhemispheric sea surface temperature variations, which are associated with hemispherically asymmetric changes in low-latitude surface pressure, winds, and low clouds, as well as the strength, location, and cross-equatorial energy transport of the Hadley cells. Models with a larger hemispheric aerosol radiative forcing gradient yield larger hemispheric temperature contrasts and, in turn, larger meridional precipitation shifts. The authors conclude that aerosols are likely the dominant driver of the observed southward tropical precipitation shift in the Pacific. Aerosols are also significant drivers of the Atlantic shifts, although one cannot rule out a contribution from natural variability to account for the magnitude of the observed shifts.},

	abstract = {Multidecadal trends in the large-scale ocean circulation are influenced by changes in radiative forcings such as long-lived greenhouse gases, volcanic aerosols, and solar irradiance. Model simulations suggest that anthropogenic aerosols can also force circulation changes, including delaying the weakening of the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation, altering the interhemispheric sea surface temperature gradient, and inducing a pan-oceanic heat redistribution. The extent to which aerosols from different regions contribute to these oceanic changes is currently unknown. Using specifically designed 20th century coupled climate model experiments that separate Asian and non-Asian aerosol impacts, it is shown that the non-Asian aerosol component, predominantly sulfate aerosols, accounts for much of the simulated aerosol-induced oceanic changes. These include delaying the weakening of the global meridional circulation, increasing the northward heat transport across the equatorial Atlantic, and inducing a subsurface cooling in the subtropical southern Indian Ocean. As global sulfate aerosol levels peaked in the 1980s, these trends may be starting to reverse. This study highlights the importance of Northern Hemisphere non-Asian anthropogenic aerosols in driving remote changes in Southern Hemisphere subtropical and extratropical oceans.},

In contrast with GFDL's CM4.0 development effort that focuses on ocean resolution for physical climate, ESM4.1 focuses on comprehensiveness of Earth system interactions. ESM4.1 features doubled horizontal resolution of both atmosphere (2° to 1°) and ocean (1° to 0.5°) relative to GFDL's previous-generation coupled ESM2-carbon and CM3-chemistry models. ESM4.1 brings together key representational advances in CM4.0 dynamics and physics along with those in aerosols and their precursor emissions, land ecosystem vegetation and canopy competition, and multiday fire; ocean ecological and biogeochemical interactions, comprehensive land-atmosphere-ocean cycling of CO2, dust and iron, and interactive ocean-atmosphere nitrogen cycling are described in detail across this volume of JAMES and presented here in terms of the overall coupling and resulting fidelity. ESM4.1 provides much improved fidelity in CO2 and chemistry over ESM2 and CM3, captures most of CM4.0's baseline simulations characteristics, and notably improves on CM4.0 in (1) Southern Ocean mode and intermediate water ventilation, (2) Southern Ocean aerosols, and (3) reduced spurious ocean heat uptake. ESM4.1 has reduced transient and equilibrium climate sensitivity compared to CM4.0. Fidelity concerns include (1) moderate degradation in sea surface temperature biases, (2) degradation in aerosols in some regions, and (3) strong centennial scale climate modulation by Southern Ocean convection.},

However, NorESM2 employs entirely different ocean and ocean biogeochemistry models.

Compared to observations and reanalyses, NorESM2 represents an improvement over previous versions of NorESM in most aspects. NorESM2 appears less sensitive to greenhouse gas forcing than its predecessors, with an estimated equilibrium climate sensitivity of 2.5\&thinsp;K in both resolutions on a 150-year time frame; however, this estimate increases with the time window and the climate sensitivity at equilibration is much higher. We also consider the model response to future scenarios as defined by selected Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) from the Scenario Model Intercomparison Project defined under CMIP6. Under the four scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5), the warming in the period 2090–2099 compared to 1850–1879 reaches 1.3, 2.2, 3.0, and 3.9\&thinsp;K in NorESM2-LM, and 1.3, 2.1, 3.1, and 3.9\&thinsp;K in NorESM-MM, robustly similar in both resolutions.

Both the host atmospheric climate model ECHAM6.3 and the aerosol model HAM2.3 were updated from previous versions. The updated version of the HAM aerosol model contains improved parameterizations of aerosol processes such as cloud activation, as well as updated emission fields for anthropogenic aerosol species and modifications in the online computation of sea salt and mineral dust aerosol emissions. Aerosol results from nudged and free-running simulations for the 10-year period 2003 to 2012 are compared to various measurements of aerosol properties. While there are regional deviations between the model and observations, the model performs well overall in terms of aerosol optical thickness, but may underestimate coarse-mode aerosol concentrations to some extent so that the modeled particles are smaller than indicated by the observations. Sulfate aerosol measurements in the US and Europe are reproduced well by the model, while carbonaceous aerosol species are biased low. Both mineral dust and sea salt aerosol concentrations are improved compared to previous versions of ECHAM–HAM. The evaluation of the simulated aerosol distributions serves as a basis for the suitability of the model for simulating aerosol–climate interactions in a changing climate.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In E63H23, the amount of low clouds, the liquid and ice water path, and cloud radiative effects are more realistic than in previous model versions. E63H23 has a more physically based aerosol activation scheme, improvements in the cloud cover scheme, changes in the detrainment of convective clouds, changes in the sticking efficiency for the accretion of ice crystals by snow, consistent ice crystal shapes throughout the model, and changes in mixed-phase freezing; an inconsistency in ice crystal number concentration (ICNC) in cirrus clouds was also removed. Common biases in ECHAM and in E63H23 (and in previous ECHAM–HAM versions) are a cloud amount in stratocumulus regions that is too low and deep convective clouds over the Atlantic and Pacific oceans that form too close to the continents (while tropical land precipitation is underestimated).

EC-Earth3-AerChem has interactive aerosols and atmospheric chemistry and contributes to the Aerosols and Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP). In this paper, we give an overview of the model, describe in detail how it differs from the other EC-Earth3 configurations, and outline the new features compared with the previously documented version of the model (EC-Earth 2.4). We explain how the model was tuned and spun up under preindustrial conditions and characterize the model's general performance on the basis of a selection of coupled simulations conducted for CMIP6. The net energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere in the preindustrial control simulation is on average {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}−{\textless}/span{\textgreater}0.09 W m{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} with a standard deviation due to interannual variability of 0.25 W m{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, showing no significant drift. The global surface air temperature in the simulation is on average 14.08 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C with an interannual standard deviation of 0.17 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C, exhibiting a small drift of 0.015 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 0.005 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C per century. The model's effective equilibrium climate sensitivity is estimated at 3.9 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C, and its transient climate response is estimated at 2.1 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C. The CMIP6 historical simulation displays spurious interdecadal variability in Northern Hemisphere temperatures, resulting in a large spread across ensemble members and a tendency to underestimate observed annual surface temperature anomalies from the early 20th century onwards. The observed warming of the Southern Hemisphere is well reproduced by the model. Compared with the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) Reanalysis version 5 (ERA5), the surface air temperature climatology for 1995–2014 has an average bias of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}−{\textless}/span{\textgreater}0.86 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 0.05 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C with a standard deviation across ensemble members of 0.35 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C in the Northern Hemisphere and 1.29 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 0.02 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C with a corresponding standard deviation of 0.05 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C in the Southern Hemisphere. The Southern Hemisphere warm bias is largely caused by errors in shortwave cloud radiative effects over the Southern Ocean, a deficiency of many climate models. Changes in the emissions of near-term climate forcers (NTCFs) have significant effects on the global climate from the second half of the 20th century onwards. For the SSP3-7.0 Shared Socioeconomic Pathway, the model gives a global warming at the end of the 21st century (2091–2100) of 4.9 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C above the preindustrial mean. A 0.5 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C stronger warming is obtained for the AerChemMIP scenario with reduced emissions of NTCFs.

The model is built with the AM4.0/LM4.0 atmosphere/land model and OM4.0 ocean model. Topics include the rationale for key choices made in the model formulation, the stability as well as drift of the preindustrial control simulation, and comparison of key aspects of the historical simulations with observations from recent decades. Notable achievements include the relatively small biases in seasonal spatial patterns of top-of-atmosphere fluxes, surface temperature, and precipitation; reduced double Intertropical Convergence Zone bias; dramatically improved representation of ocean boundary currents; a high-quality simulation of climatological Arctic sea ice extent and its recent decline; and excellent simulation of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation spectrum and structure. Areas of concern include inadequate deep convection in the Nordic Seas; an inaccurate Antarctic sea ice simulation; precipitation and wind composites still affected by the equatorial cold tongue bias; muted variability in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation; strong 100 year quasiperiodicity in Southern Ocean ventilation; and a lack of historical warming before 1990 and too rapid warming thereafter due to high climate sensitivity and strong aerosol forcing, in contrast to the observational record. Overall, CM4.0 scores very well in its fidelity against observations compared to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 generation in terms of both mean state and modes of variability and should prove a valuable new addition for analysis across a broad array of applications.},

The aerosol module has in this study been implemented and applied in CAM5.3-Oslo. This model is based on CAM5.3–CESM1.2 and its own predecessor model version CAM4-Oslo. OsloAero5.3 has improved treatment of emissions, aerosol chemistry, particle life cycle, and aerosol–cloud interactions compared to its predecessor OsloAero4.0 in CAM4-Oslo. The main new features consist of improved aerosol sources; the module now explicitly accounts for aerosol particle nucleation and secondary organic aerosol production, with new emissions schemes also for sea salt, dimethyl sulfide (DMS), and marine primary organics. Mineral dust emissions are updated as well, adopting the formulation of CESM1.2. The improved model representation of aerosol–cloud interactions now resolves heterogeneous ice nucleation based on black carbon (BC) and mineral dust calculated by the model and treats the activation of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) as in CAM5.3. Compared to OsloAero4.0 in CAM4-Oslo, the black carbon (BC) mass concentrations are less excessive aloft, with a better fit to observations. Near-surface mass concentrations of BC and sea salt aerosols are also less biased, while sulfate and mineral dust are slightly more biased. Although appearing quite similar for CAM5.3-Oslo and CAM4-Oslo, the validation results for organic matter (OM) are inconclusive, since both of the respective versions of OsloAero are equipped with a limited number of OM tracers for the sake of computational efficiency. Any information about the assumed mass ratios of OM to organic carbon (OC) for different types of OM sources is lost in the transport module. Assuming that observed OC concentrations scaled by 1.4 are representative for the modeled OM concentrations, CAM5.3-Oslo with OsloAero5.3 is slightly inferior for the very sparsely available observation data. Comparing clear-sky column-integrated optical properties with data from ground-based remote sensing, we find a negative bias in optical depth globally; however, it is not as strong as in CAM4-Oslo, but has positive biases in some areas typically dominated by mineral dust emissions. Aerosol absorption has a larger negative bias than the optical depth globally. This is reflected in a lower positive bias in areas where mineral dust is the main contributor to absorption. Globally, the low bias in absorption is smaller than in CAM4-Oslo. The Ångström parameter exhibits small biases both globally and regionally, suggesting that the aerosol particle sizes are reasonably well represented. Cloud-top droplet number concentrations over oceans are generally underestimated compared to satellite retrievals, but seem to be overestimated downwind of major emissions of dust and biomass burning sources. Finally, we find small changes in direct radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere, while the cloud radiative forcing due to anthropogenic aerosols is now more negative than in CAM4-Oslo, being on the strong side compared to the multi-model estimate in IPCC AR5. Although not all validation results in this study show improvement for the present CAM5.3-Oslo version, the extended and updated aerosol module OsloAero5.3 is more advanced and applicable than its predecessor OsloAero4.0, as it includes new parameterizations that more readily facilitate sensitivity and process studies and use in climate and Earth system model studies in general.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To facilitate the use of the BCC-ESM1 datasets, this study describes the experiment settings and summarizes the model outputs in detail. Preliminary evaluations of BCC-ESM1 are also presented, revealing that: the climate sensitivities of BCC-ESM1 are well within the likely ranges suggested by IPCC AR5; the spatial structures of annual mean surface air temperature and precipitation can be reasonably captured, despite some common precipitation biases as in CMIP5 and CMIP6 models; a spurious cooling bias from the 1960s to 1990s is evident in BCC-ESM1, as in most other ESMs; and the mean states of surface sulfate concentrations can also be reasonably reproduced, as well as their temporal evolution at regional scales.

A three-mode representation of the aerosol in version 5.1 of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5.1) yields global annual mean radiative forcing estimates for each of these forcing mechanisms that are within 0.1 W m−2 of estimates using a more complex seven-mode representation that distinguishes between fresh and aged black carbon and primary organic matter. Simulating fresh black carbon particles separately from internally mixed accumulation mode particles is found to be important only near fossil fuel sources. In addition to the usual large indirect effect on solar radiation, this study finds an unexpectedly large positive longwave indirect effect (because of enhanced cirrus produced by homogenous nucleation of ice crystals on anthropogenic sulfate), small shortwave and longwave semidirect effects, and a small direct effect (because of cancelation and interactions of direct effects of black carbon and sulfate). Differences between the three-mode and seven-mode versions are significantly larger (up to 0.2 W m−2) when the hygroscopicity of primary organic matter is decreased from 0.1 to 0 and transfer of the primary carbonaceous aerosol to the accumulation mode in the seven-mode version requires more hygroscopic material coating the primary particles. Radiative forcing by cloudborne anthropogenic black carbon is only −0.07 W m−2.},

But this feature only dominates the historical climate change early in the twentieth century. In the second half of the twentieth century, anthropogenic aerosol emissions increase monotonically in Asia, but increase first and then decrease rapidly over Europe and North America. The shift of aerosol emissions from the western mid-latitude NH to the eastern low-latitude NH induces distinct climate response patterns compared with its global increase effect, anchoring an equatorial symmetric tropical sea surface temperature (SST) cooling and precipitation decrease, which resembles that in the GHG-induced response patterns with sign reversed. After the mid-1970s, with declining aerosol emissions over Europe and North America and increasing emissions in Asia, anthropogenic aerosol forcing generates a northward recovery of the tropical rainfall with little response in the tropical SST anomalies due to the cancellation effect of the distinct aerosol emissions conditions between the western and the eastern NH. While GHG forcing dominates observed climate change in the twentieth century, the distinct climate response patterns to the spatial and temporal evolutions of anthropogenic aerosol forcing highlight its important role in shaping the regional climate changes.},

	abstract = {The geographical shift of global anthropogenic aerosols from the developed countries to the Asian continent since the 1980s could potentially perturb the regional and global climate due to aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions. We use an atmospheric general circulation model with different aerosol scenarios to investigate the radiative and microphysical effects of anthropogenic aerosols from different regions on the radiation budget, precipitation, and large-scale circulations. An experiment contrasting anthropogenic aerosol scenarios in 1970 and 2010 shows that the altered cloud reflectivity and solar extinction by aerosols results in regional surface temperature cooling in East and South Asia, and warming in the US and Europe, respectively. These aerosol-induced temperature changes are consistent with the relative temperature trends from 1980 to 2010 over different regions in the reanalysis data. A reduced meridional streamfunction and zonal winds over the tropics as well as a poleward shift of the jet stream suggest weakened and expanded tropical circulations, which are induced by the redistributed aerosols through a relaxing of the meridional temperature gradient. Consequently, precipitation is suppressed in the deep tropics and enhanced in the subtropics. Our assessments of the aerosol effects over the different regions suggest that the increasing Asian pollution accounts for the weakening of the tropics circulation, while the decreasing pollution in Europe and US tends to shift the circulation systems southward. Moreover, the aerosol indirect forcing is predominant over the total aerosol forcing in magnitude, while aerosol radiative and microphysical effects jointly shape the meridional energy distributions and modulate the circulation systems.},

We examine the amplified warming in the Arctic and Antarctic in 17 global climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) against satellite data. Large hemispheric differences in PA strength was found in the CMIP6 models. Changes in surface temperature and strength of PA is closely coupled to changes in albedo. The planetary albedo of Earth (αp) is partitioned into a component associated with surface albedo (defined as surface contribution to planetary albedo, ), and a component associated with atmospheric albedo (atmospheric contribution to planetary albedo, ). To assess the hemispheric differences in PA strengths, the relative importance of and were investigated. The surface reflection looks different as seen at the surface (defined as surface albedo, αsurf) compared to (as seen at the top of the atmosphere). We find a stronger correlation between surface temperature and αsurf in the Arctic than in the Antarctic, with correlation coefficients of −0.94 and −0.88, respectively. Interestingly, the correlation for surface temperature and is stronger in the Antarctic than in the Arctic with correlation coefficients of −0.93 and −0.90, respectively. In the southern high latitudes, albedo changes at the surface are more important than changes in the atmosphere, while the opposite applies in the northern high latitudes. Surface temperature changes in the low- and mid-latitudes are strongly associated with changes in , dominated by changes in cloud properties.},

	abstract = {Aerosols continue to contribute the largest uncertainty in climate change. Over Asia, a global aerosol hotspot, spatial patterns of aerosol emissions are changing mainly because of changes in anthropogenic emissions, producing a dipole in atmospheric aerosol loading between East (decrease in emissions) and South Asia (increase in emissions). The resultant aerosol radiative effects are expected to be different as compared to the last decades of the 20th century because of this emerging Asian aerosol dipole. The projection and assessments of radiative and climate impacts of aerosols rely on simulating accurately the aerosol properties, thus, making it imperative that current climate models involved in climate assessments including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Reports, simulate well the magnitude and trends in changing aerosol properties. For the first time, in this study we analyze trends in aerosol properties over Asia from satellite and ground-based observations, and simulations from climate models in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) experiment with state-of-the-art treatment of aerosol chemistry, physics and meteorology. The results reveal large inter-model differences in model estimates, and discrepancies between model simulations and observations as most models are not able to capture the recent observed magnitudes and trends in aerosol optical depth (AOD) and single scattering albedo (SSA) over Asia. The absolute and the relative (percent) trends (positive and/or negative) in AOD are significantly higher than the trends in SSA. The aerosol-induced effective radiative forcing within the atmosphere simulated with three CMIP6 models show a positive (increasing) trend over Asia. A positive trend in atmospheric heating due to aerosols in model simulations is consistent with model simulated trends in AOD (positive) and SSA (negative). These results on model-observations comparison need to be taken into account while examining the projected/expected future climate impacts due to aerosols, and potential value of various mitigation measures, in particular on regional and decadal climate change in Asia which is largely uncertain.
Main finding
Our analysis of satellite and ground-based observations, and simulations from climate models in CMIP6 experiment with state-of-the-art treatment of aerosol chemistry, physics and meteorology reveal large difference in model calculations, and most models are not able to capture the recent observed trends in aerosol optical depth and single scattering albedo over Asia during 2000-2018.},

Here we use a global composition-climate model to show that changes in cloud water pH over the 1970–2009 period strongly affects the aerosol particle size distribution, cloud condensation nuclei concentrations, and the magnitude of aerosol radiative forcing. The simulated all-sky aerosol radiative forcing (1970–2009) over the North Atlantic is +1.2 W m−2 if pH remains constant at 5.0, as in many climate models. However, the forcing increases to +5.2 W m−2 if pH is assumed to increase by 1.0 unit over this period. Global composition climate models need to account for variations in cloud water pH to improve the representation of sulfate aerosol formation and aerosol radiative effects.},

It can be used as a stand alone land surface model driven by observed forcing data, or coupled to an atmospheric global circulation model. The JULES model has been coupled to the Met Office Unified Model (UM) and as such provides a unique opportunity for the research community to contribute their research to improve both world-leading operational weather forecasting and climate change prediction systems. In addition JULES, and its forerunner MOSES, have been the basis for a number of very high-profile papers concerning the land-surface and climate over the last decade. JULES has a modular structure aligned to physical processes, providing the basis for a flexible modelling platform.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

N96ORCA1 has a horizontal resolution of 135 km in the atmosphere and 1° in the ocean and requires an order of magnitude less computing power than its medium-resolution counterpart, N216ORCA025, while retaining a high degree of performance traceability. Scientific performance is compared to both observations and the N216ORCA025 model. N96ORCA1 reproduces observed climate mean and variability almost as well as N216ORCA025. Patterns of biases are similar across the two models. In the northwest Atlantic, N96ORCA1 shows a cold surface bias of up to 6 K, typical of ocean models of this resolution. The strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (16 to 17 Sv) matches observations. In the Southern Ocean, a warm surface bias (up to 2 K) is smaller than in N216ORCA025 and linked to improved ocean circulation. Model El Niño/Southern Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Variability are close to observations. Both the cold bias in the Northern Hemisphere (N96ORCA1) and the warm bias in the Southern Hemisphere (N216ORCA025) develop in the first few decades of the simulations. As in many comparable climate models, simulated interhemispheric gradients of top-of-atmosphere radiation are larger than observations suggest, with contributions from both hemispheres. HadGEM3 GC3.1 N96ORCA1 constitutes the physical core of the UK Earth System Model (UKESM1) and will be used extensively in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6), both as part of the UK Earth System Model and as a stand-alone coupled climate model.},

The calculation of particle number concentration (PNC), one of the critical parameters affecting RFaci, is generally simplified in climate models. Here we employ outputs from long-term (30-year) simulations of a global size-resolved (sectional) aerosol microphysics model and a machine-learning tool to develop a Random Forest Regression Model (RFRM) for PNC. We have implemented the PNC RFRM in GISS-ModelE2.1 with a mass-based One-Moment Aerosol module, which is one of CMIP6 models. Compared to the default setting, the GISS-ModelE2.1 simulation based on RFRM reduces the changes of cloud droplet number concentration associated with anthropogenic emissions, and decreases the RFaci from −1.46 to −1.11 W·m−2. This work highlights a promising approach based on machine learning to reduce uncertainties of climate models in predicting PNC and RFaci without compromising their computing efficiency.},

The base currency in this model was nitrogen from which fluxes of organic carbon, including export to the deep ocean, were calculated by invoking fixed C:N ratios in phytoplankton, zooplankton and detritus. However, due to anthropogenic activity, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO$_{\textrm{2}}$) has significantly increased above its natural, inter-glacial background. As such, simulating and predicting the carbon cycle in the ocean in its entirety, including ventilation of CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ with the atmosphere and the resulting impact of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems, requires that both organic and inorganic carbon be afforded a more complete representation in the model specification. Here, we introduce MEDUSA-2.0, an expanded successor model which includes additional state variables for dissolved inorganic carbon, alkalinity, dissolved oxygen and detritus carbon (permitting variable C:N in exported organic matter), as well as a simple benthic formulation and extended parameterizations of phytoplankton growth, calcification and detritus remineralisation. A full description of MEDUSA-2.0, including its additional functionality, is provided and a multi-decadal spin-up simulation (1860–2005) is performed. The biogeochemical performance of the model is evaluated using a diverse range of observational data, and MEDUSA-2.0 is assessed relative to comparable models using output from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Methods for estimating the dry deposition velocities of atmospheric gases in the U.S. and surrounding areas have been improved and incorporated into a revised computer code module for use in numerical models of atmospheric transport and deposition of pollutants over regional scales. The key improvement is the computation of bulk surface resistances along three distinct pathways of mass transfer to sites of deposition at the upper portions of vegetative canopies or structures, the lower portions, and the ground (or water surface). This approach replaces the previous technique of providing simple look-up tables of bulk surface resistances. With the surface resistances divided explicitly into distinct pathways, the bulk surface resistances for a large number of gases in addition to those usually addressed in acid deposition models (SO2,O3, NOx and HNO3) can be computed, if estimates of the effective Henry's Law constants and appropriate measures of the chemical reactivity of the various substances are known. This has been accomplished successfully for H2O2, HCHO, CH3CHO (to represent other aldehydes), CH3O2H (to represent organic peroxides), CH3C(O)O2H, HCOOH (to represent organic acids), NH3, CH3C(O)O2NO2 and HNO2. Other factors considered include surface temperature, stomatal response to environmental parameters, the wetting of surfaces by dew and rain, and the covering of surfaces by snow. Surface emission of gases and variations of uptake characteristics by individual plant species within the landuse types are not considered explicitly.},

	abstract = {We have used 210Pb, a tracer originating from the radioactive decay of 222Rn emitted from soils, to validate different wet and dry deposition schemes in our global three-dimensional off-line chemical transport model, TOMCAT. We have tested two different parameterizations for the dry deposition, one with the turbulent exchange in the boundary layer and one without. When dry deposition is linked to the boundary layer scheme, the model shows the ability to resolve shallow mixing depths in winter with enhanced lifetimes and concentrations of surface aerosol. Three conceptually different wet deposition schemes have been implemented and tested in TOMCAT. In the first, where wet removal is assumed to be proportional to the local gradient of the specific humidity, the model has a global mean bias for the surface concentrations of −40\%. Using this scheme, the observed surface concentrations are seriously underpredicted, and most of the aerosol burden is scavenged within the boundary layer. In the second scheme, where scavenging is parameterized proportional to the model-derived total precipitation rate (large scale and convective), the model exhibits a +26\% bias. The concentrations are overpredicted, especially in continental areas as this scheme fails to capture the coupling between vertical transport and rainout. In the third scheme, wet removal is coupled with the vertical transport inside convective clouds. The model then shows the best performance with only a −4\% bias for the concentrations. Furthermore, other regional discrepancies between model and observations point to a variability in 222Rn emissions, which was not taken into account with our simple 222Rn emission scenario, and also to anomalies in our model-derived precipitation rate. The aerosol residence times are realistic only when the wet removal schemes use the precipitation rate rather than the specific humidity. The dry subtropical and polar regions can be captured with lifetimes at 500 hPa of more than 50 days whereas in regions of high precipitation the lifetimes are less than 5 days.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric aerosols exert substantial influence on the environment and climate changes. As global climate models have become a primary tool to understand the roles of aerosols in the Earth system, it is essential to obtain a comprehensive knowledge of model capability in reproducing various aerosol properties. Here, we assess the performance of the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) models in simulating the annual mean AOD climatology and its seasonality in Eastern Central China (ECC) over 2000 to 2014 and explore the underlying reasons for their performance. Compared with CMIP5 models, CMIP6 models better capture the magnitude of annual mean AOD climatology over ECC with a notable enhancement of 52.98\% resulting from a significant increase in the simulated magnitude of dominant sulfate AOD. However, CMIP6 models fail to capture the seasonally south-north shift of AOD maximum centers. Specifically, two centers of maximum AOD in spring over South China (SC) and in summer over North China (NC) are underestimated, which are due to the negative biases in the simulation of organic aerosol (OA) AOD and sulfate AOD separately. Specifically, two centers of maximum AOD in spring over South China (SC) and in summer over North China (NC) are underestimated, which are due to the negative biases in the simulation of organic aerosol (OA) AOD and sulfate AOD separately. Our analysis suggests that the overestimated precipitation and underestimated liquid water path (LWP) in CMIP6 models, lead to the deficiency in modelled sulfate AOD by affecting sulfate aerosol concentrations through wet deposition and aqueous-phase production. Our study calls for more attention to improving simulations of aerosol seasonality in global climate models.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and methyl hydroperoxide (MHP, CH3OOH) serve as HOx (OH and HO2 radicals) reservoirs and therefore as useful tracers of HOx chemistry. Both hydroperoxides were measured during the 2016–2018 Atmospheric Tomography Mission as part of a global survey of the remote troposphere over the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean basins conducted using the NASA DC-8 aircraft. To assess the relative contributions of chemical and physical processes to the global hydroperoxide budget and their impact on atmospheric oxidation potential, we compare the observations with two models, a diurnal steady-state photochemical box model and the global chemical transport model Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS)-Chem. We find that the models systematically under-predict H2O2 by 5\%–20\% and over-predict MHP by 40\%–50\% relative to measurements. In the marine boundary layer, over-predictions of H2O2 in a photochemical box model are used to estimate H2O2 boundary-layer mean deposition velocities of 1.0–1.32 cm s−1, depending on season; this process contributes to up to 5\%–10\% of HOx loss in this region. In the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, MHP is under-predicted and H2O2 is over-predicted by a factor of 2–3 on average. The differences between the observations and predictions are associated with recent convection: MHP is under-estimated and H2O2 is over-estimated in air parcels that have experienced recent convective influence.},

	abstract = {In this study, we show using a state-of-the-art Earth system model, UKESM1, that emissions and climate scenario depending, there could be large changes in surface ozone by the end of the twenty-first century, with unprecedentedly large increases over South and East Asia. We also show that statistical modelling of the trends in future ozone works well in reproducing the model output between 1900 and 2050. However, beyond 2050, and especially under large climate change scenarios, the statistical model results are in poorer agreement with the fully interactive Earth system model output. This suggests that additional processes occurring in the Earth system model such as changes in the production of ozone at higher temperatures or changes in the influx of ozone from the stratosphere, which are not captured by the statistical model, have a first order impact on the evolution of surface ozone over the twenty-first century. We show in a series of idealized box model simulations, with two different chemical schemes, that changes in temperature lead to diverging responses between the schemes. This points at the chemical mechanisms as being a source of uncertainty in the response of ozone to changes in temperature, and so climate, in the future. This underscores the need for more work to be performed to better understand the response of ozone to changes in temperature and constrain how well this relationship is simulated in models.

The biases may be caused by either the emission inventory or the treatment of aerosol processes in the models, or both, but so far no consensus has been reached. In this study, a relatively new emission inventory based on energy statistics and technology, Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC), is used to drive the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) to evaluate aerosol distribution and radiative effects against observations in China. The model results are compared with the model simulations with the widely used Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) emission inventory. We find that the new MEIC emission improves the aerosol optical depth (AOD) simulations in eastern China and explains 22–28\&thinsp;\% of the AOD low bias simulated with the AR5 emission. However, AOD is still biased low in eastern China. Seasonal variation of the MEIC emission leads to a better agreement with the observed seasonal variation of primary aerosols than the AR5 emission, but the concentrations are still underestimated. This implies that the atmospheric loadings of primary aerosols are closely related to the emission, which may still be underestimated over eastern China. In contrast, the seasonal variations of secondary aerosols depend more on aerosol processes (e.g., gas- and aqueous-phase production from precursor gases) that are associated with meteorological conditions and to a lesser extent on the emission. It indicates that the emissions of precursor gases for the secondary aerosols alone cannot explain the low bias in the model. Aerosol secondary production processes in CAM5 should also be revisited. The simulation using MEIC estimates the annual-average aerosol direct radiative effects (ADREs) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), at the surface, and in the atmosphere to be {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}−{\textless}/span{\textgreater}5.02, {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}−{\textless}/span{\textgreater}18.47, and 13.45\&thinsp;W\&thinsp;m{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, respectively, over eastern China, which are enhanced by {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}−{\textless}/span{\textgreater}0.91, {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}−{\textless}/span{\textgreater}3.48, and 2.57\&thinsp;W\&thinsp;m{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} compared with the AR5 emission. The differences of ADREs by using MEIC and AR5 emissions are larger than the decadal changes of the modeled ADREs, indicating the uncertainty of the emission inventories. This study highlights the importance of improving both the emission and aerosol secondary production processes in modeling the atmospheric aerosols and their radiative effects. Yet, if the estimations of MEIC emissions in trace gases do not suffer similar biases to those in the AOD, our findings will help affirm a fundamental error in the conversion from precursor gases to secondary aerosols as hinted in other recent studies following different approaches.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We compare these with box model and three-dimensional (3-D) chemistry-transport model results for “background” and “convective” conditions. Generally, we obtain good agreement between the model and measurement data, although the 3-D model tends to underestimate HCHO near the tropopause, whereas the box model tends to slightly overestimate HCHO for the background case. Sensitivity simulations indicate that the most important factors determining HCHO concentrations are the abundances of NO, reactive hydrocarbons (e.g., isoprene), CH3OOH, CH3OH, and acetone and also the level of irradiance. In the middle and upper troposphere the most important HCHO production term is the reaction of CH3O2 with NO (68 ± 10\%, including a contribution of 38 ± 7\% from CH4 oxidation), followed by the destruction of CH3OOH by OH and photolysis (14 ± 2\%), and the reaction of CH3OH with OH (14 ± 8\%). HCHO loss is dominated by photolysis rather than by the reaction with OH, except in the upper tropospheric convective case, where the loss by OH contributes about 50\%. Our measurements furthermore indicate that convective transport of H2O2 can be very efficient.},

HOOVER included two airborne field campaigns, in October 2006 and July 2007.

We find negative concentration gradients with increasing latitude throughout the troposphere for H$_{\textrm{2}}$O$_{\textrm{2}}$ and CH$_{\textrm{3}}$OOH*. In contrast, observed HCHO is almost homogeneously distributed over central and northern Europe and is elevated over the Mediterranean. In general, the measured gradients tend to be steepest entering the Mediterranean region, where we also find the highest abundances of the 3 species. Mixing ratios of these tracers generally decrease with altitude. H$_{\textrm{2}}$O$_{\textrm{2}}$ and CH$_{\textrm{3}}$OOH* show maxima above the boundary layer at 2–5 km, being more distinct over southern than over northern Europe. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} We also present a comparison of our data with simulations by two global 3-D-models, MATCH-MPIC and EMAC, and with the box model CAABA.

	abstract = {Aerosols are involved in a complex set of processes that operate across many spatial and temporal scales. Understanding these processes, and ensuring their accurate representation in models of transport, radiation transfer, and climate, requires knowledge of aerosol physical, chemical, and optical properties and the distributions of these properties in space and time. To derive aerosol climate forcing, aerosol optical and microphysical properties and their spatial and temporal distributions, and aerosol interactions with clouds, need to be understood. Such data are also required in conjunction with size-resolved chemical composition in order to evaluate chemical transport models and to distinguish natural and anthropogenic forcing. Other basic parameters needed for modeling the radiative influences of aerosols are surface reflectivity and three-dimensional cloud fields. This large suite of parameters mandates an integrated observing and modeling system of commensurate scope. The Progressive Aerosol Retrieval and Assimilation Global Observing Network (PARAGON) concept, designed to meet this requirement, is motivated by the need to understand climate system sensitivity to changes in atmospheric constituents, to reduce climate model uncertainties, and to analyze diverse collections of data pertaining to aerosols. This paper highlights several challenges resulting from the complexity of the problem. Approaches for dealing with them are offered in the set of companion papers.},

The DMS concentrations in historical simulations systematically underestimate the most widely used observed climatology but compare more favourably against two recent observation-based datasets. The models better reproduce observations in mid to high latitudes, as well as in polar and westerlies marine biomes. The resulting multi-model estimate of contemporary global ocean DMS emissions is 16–24 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Tg S yr$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, which is narrower than the observational-derived range of 16 to 28 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Tg S yr$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}. The four models disagree on the sign of the trend of the global DMS flux from 1980 onwards, with two models showing an increase and two models a decrease. At the global scale, these trends are dominated by changes in surface DMS concentrations in all models, irrespective of the air–sea flux parameterisation used. In turn, three models consistently show that changes in DMS concentrations are correlated with changes in marine productivity; however, marine productivity is poorly constrained in the current generation of ESMs, thus limiting the predictive ability of this relationship. In contrast, a consensus is found among all models over polar latitudes where an increasing trend is predominantly driven by the retreating sea-ice extent. However, the magnitude of this trend between models differs by a factor of 3, from 2.9 to 9.2 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Gg S decade$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} over the period 1980–2014, which is at the low end of a recent satellite-derived analysis.

	abstract = {Anthropogenic activities have drastically impacted the climate system since the Industrial Revolution. However, to what extent anthropogenic emissions influence the cloud droplet number concentration (Nd), the critical parameter for understanding aerosol-cloud interactions, is poorly known on the hemispheric scale due to the considerable retrieval uncertainty. We employed multiple widely used Nd retrieval sampling methods to evaluate the long-term trend in Nd contrast (ΔNd(NH-SH)) between the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH). Here we show that the ΔNd(NH-SH) was halved from 2003 to 2020 using different sampling methods and channels, even though the range of magnitudes of ΔNd(NH-SH) from different retrieval sampling methods is large. Such dramatic changes in ΔNd(NH-SH) are dominated by the significantly decreased Nd over the NH (∼20\%) due to emission reductions compared to the relatively stable and pristine nature of the SH. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol index (AI) correlate poorly with Nd based on long-term trends, even though they replicate the contrast trends. This poor correlation is partly contributed by stratospheric smoke from wildfires in Australia that had little influence on Nd in the SH. The northwest Atlantic shows the largest contribution, ∼38\%, to the Nd trend, whereas the northwest Pacific dominates the change in AOD and AI, contributing more than 60\% to AOD and ∼50\% to the AI trend in the NH. Our results imply that emission reductions significantly reduced ΔNd(NH-SH) and provide strong observational evidence that anthropogenic activities have extensively altered liquid clouds in the NH in the last two decades.},

	abstract = {Over the CMIP6 historical period (1850–2014), aerosols provided the largest negative forcing compared to all other climate forcings via their ability to absorb or scatter solar radiation and alter clouds. Aerosols played an important role in counterbalancing warming by greenhouse gases (GHGs). Here we study aerosol forcing trends in the CMIP6 simulations of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) ocean-atmosphere ModelE version 2.1 (GISS-E2.1-G) using a fully coupled atmospheric composition configuration, including interactive gas-phase chemistry, and either an aerosol microphysical (MATRIX) or a mass-based aerosol (OMA) module. Simulations of the CMIP6 historical period are analyzed as well as four Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) future scenarios for 2015–2100: SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5. The main conclusion of this study is that aerosol forcing in the GISS model has reached its turning point, switching from globally increasing to a decreasing trend in the first decade of the 21st century. This result is robust, independent of which aerosol module or SSP scenario is used. Non-linear aerosol-cloud interactions dominate as a forcing agent over aerosol-radiation interactions. Aerosols' ability to counterbalance GHG forcing on the global scale is today at a level comparable to that at the beginning of the last century. In the 1980s, the decade of largest global aerosol loads, aerosols balanced up to 80\% of GHG forcing. As a consequence, global warming of the last decades, which is primarily driven by greenhouse gases, has been augmented by the effect of decreasing aerosol cooling in our model. By the end of this century, following the SSP scenarios, aerosols will only counterbalance 0\%–20\% of GHG forcing, depending on model and on scenario.},

	abstract = {Methane (CH4) is one of the most important trace gases in the atmosphere owing to its role as an exceedingly effective greenhouse gas and atmospheric pollutant. Better understanding of the global methane cycle and its interactions with the Earth system is therefore necessary for robust future projections of anthropogenic climate change and assessments of multi-gas mitigation strategies. Here we present a newly developed methane emission-driven Earth system model to simulate the global methane cycle fully interactively. We provide an evaluation of methane sources and sinks and a full-cycle methane budget and its change over the historic period. We further evaluate the methane atmospheric abundance and lifetime against available observations. The new methane emission-driven model simulates all the components of the methane cycle within observational uncertainty. We calculate a total present-day (2000–2009 decadal average) methane source of 591 Tg(CH4) yr−1 with 197 Tg(CH4) yr−1 coming from wetlands. These sources are nearly balanced by the global methane sinks amounting to 580 Tg (CH4) yr−1; reaction of methane with the hydroxyl radical in the troposphere alone removes 525 Tg(CH4) yr−1. The imbalance between sources and sinks of 11 Tg(CH4) yr−1 represents the atmospheric methane growth rate and is in fairly good agreement with current best estimates of 5.8 Tg(CH4) yr−1 with a range of 4.9–6.6 Tg(CH4) yr−1. At present-day the model shows a maximum systematic negative-bias of approximately 200 ppb in the methane surface mole fraction.},

	abstract = {Aerosol optical thickness (AOT) has decreased substantially in Europe in the summer half year (April – September) since 1980, with almost a 50\% reduction in Central and Eastern Europe, according to MERRA-2 reanalysis. At the same time, strong positive trends in ERA5 reanalysis surface solar radiation downwards for all-sky and clear-sky conditions (SSRD and SSRDc, respectively) and temperature at 2 m are found for Europe in summer during the period 1979 –2020. The GEBA observations show as well strong increases in SSRD during the latest four decades. Estimations of changes in SSRDc, using the Santa Barbara Disort Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model, show similarly strong increases when fed by MERRA-2 AOT. The estimates of warming in this study, caused by increases in SSRD and SSRDc, are based on energy budget approximations and the Stefan Boltzmann law. The increases in near surface temperature, estimated both for clear-sky and all-sky conditions, are up to about one degree for Central and Eastern Europe. The total warming over large parts of this region for clear-sky conditions is however nearly double the global mean temperature increase of 1.1 °C, while somewhat less for all-sky conditions. The effects of aerosols on warming over the southerly Iberian Peninsula are weaker compared to countries further north. The rapid total warming over the Iberian Peninsula is probably caused by greenhouse warming, drier surface conditions and to some degree decline in aerosols. Reduced cloud cover is found for large parts of Europe in summer during the latest four decades.},

These, and other, influences on regional climate from changes in aerosol emissions are expected to continue, and potentially strengthen, in the coming decades. However, a combination of large uncertainties in emissions 5 pathways, radiative forcing, and the dynamical response to forcing makes anthropogenic aerosol a key factor in the spread in near-term climate projections, particularly on regional scales, and therefore an important one to constrain. For example, in terms of future emissions pathways, the uncertainty in future global aerosol and precursor gas emissions by 2050 is as large as the total increase in emissions since 1850. In terms of aerosol effective radiative forcing, which remains the largest source of uncertainty in future climate change projections, CMIP6 models span a factor of five, from -0.3 to -1.5 W m−2. Both of these 10 sources of uncertainty are exacerbated on regional scales.},

	title = {Variable {CCN} formation potential of regional sulfur emissions},
	abstract = {Aerosols are short lived so their geographical distribution and impact on climate depends on where they are emitted. Previous model studies have shown that the mass of sulfate aerosol produced per unit sulfur emission (the sulfate burden potential) and the associated direct radiative forcing vary regionally because of differences in meteorology and photochemistry. Using a global model of aerosol microphysics, we show that the total number of aerosol particles produced per unit sulfur emission (the aerosol number potential) has a different regional variation to that of sulfate mass. The aerosol number potential of N. American and Asian emissions is calculated to be a factor of 3 to 4 times greater than that of European emissions, even though Europe has a higher sulfate burden potential. Pollution from N. America and Asia tends to reach higher altitudes than European pollution so forms more new particles through nucleation. Regional differences in particle production and growth mean that sulfur emissions from N. America and E. Asia produce 50 nm diameter cloud condensation nuclei up to 70\% more efﬁciently than Europe. For 80 nm diameter CCN, N. America and Europe produce CCN 2.5 times more efﬁciently than E. Asia. The impact of regional sulfur emissions on particle concentrations is also much more widely spread than the impact on sulfate mass, due to efﬁcient particle production in the free troposphere during long range transport. These results imply that regional sulfur emissions will have different climate forcing potentials through changes in cloud drop number.},

The primary goals of the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project (DAMIP) are to facilitate improved estimation of the contributions of anthropogenic and natural forcing changes to observed global warming as well as to observed global and regional changes in other climate variables; to contribute to the estimation of how historical emissions have altered and are altering contemporary climate risk; and to facilitate improved observationally constrained projections of future climate change. D\&amp;A studies typically require unforced control simulations and historical simulations including all major anthropogenic and natural forcings. Such simulations will be carried out as part of the DECK and the CMIP6 historical simulation. In addition D\&amp;A studies require simulations covering the historical period driven by individual forcings or subsets of forcings only: such simulations are proposed here. Key novel features of the experimental design presented here include firstly new historical simulations with aerosols-only, stratospheric-ozone-only, CO2-only, solar-only, and volcanic-only forcing, facilitating an improved estimation of the climate response to individual forcing, secondly future single forcing experiments, allowing observationally constrained projections of future climate change, and thirdly an experimental design which allows models with and without coupled atmospheric chemistry to be compared on an equal footing.},

In addition, the acidity of atmospheric aqueous phases, e.g., deliquesced aerosol particles, cloud, and fog droplets, is also dictated by aqueous-phase chemistry. These feedbacks between acidity and chemistry have crucial implications for the tropospheric lifetime of air pollutants, atmospheric composition, deposition to terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems, visibility, climate, and human health. Atmospheric research has made substantial progress in understanding feedbacks between acidity and multiphase chemistry during recent decades. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge on these feedbacks with a focus on aerosol and cloud systems, which involve both inorganic and organic aqueous-phase chemistry. Here, we describe the impacts of acidity on the phase partitioning of acidic and basic gases and buffering phenomena. Next, we review feedbacks of different acidity regimes on key chemical reaction mechanisms and kinetics, as well as uncertainties and chemical subsystems with incomplete information. Finally, we discuss atmospheric implications and highlight the need for future investigations, particularly with respect to reducing emissions of key acid precursors in a changing world, and the need for advancements in field and laboratory measurements and model tools.},

Across CMIP6 models, it is shown that there is a strong correlation between surface heat loss over the subpolar North Atlantic (SPNA) and the forced strengthening of the AMOC. Despite the link to AA forcing, the AMOC response is not strongly related to the contribution of anomalous downwelling surface shortwave radiation to SPNA heat loss. Rather, the spread in AMOC response is primarily due to the spread in turbulent heat loss. We hypothesize that turbulent heat loss is larger in models with strong AA forcing because the air advected over the ocean is colder and drier, in turn because of greater AA-forced cooling over the continents upwind, especially North America. The strengthening of the AMOC also feeds back on itself positively in two distinct ways: by raising the sea surface temperature and hence further increasing turbulent heat loss in the SPNA, and by increasing the sea surface density across the SPNA due to increased northward transport of saline water. A comparison of key indices suggests that the AMOC response in models with strong AA forcing is not likely to be consistent with observations.},

Substantial changes in anthropogenic aerosols and precursor gas emissions have occurred over recent decades due to the implementation of air pollution control legislation and economic growth. The response of atmospheric aerosols to these changes and the impact on climate are poorly constrained, particularly in studies using detailed aerosol chemistry–climate models. Here we compare the HadGEM3-UKCA (Hadley Centre Global Environment Model-United Kingdom Chemistry and Aerosols) coupled chemistry–climate model for the period 1960–2009 against extensive ground-based observations of sulfate aerosol mass (1978–2009), total suspended particle matter (SPM, 1978–1998), PM10 (1997–2009), aerosol optical depth (AOD, 2000–2009), aerosol size distributions (2008–2009) and surface solar radiation (SSR, 1960–2009) over Europe. The model underestimates observed sulfate aerosol mass (normalised mean bias factor (NMBF) = −0.4), SPM (NMBF = −0.9), PM10 (NMBF = −0.2), aerosol number concentrations (N30 NMBF = −0.85; N50 NMBF = −0.65; and N100 NMBF = −0.96) and AOD (NMBF = −0.01) but slightly overpredicts SSR (NMBF = 0.02). Trends in aerosol over the observational period are well simulated by the model, with observed (simulated) changes in sulfate of −68 \% (−78 \%), SPM of −42 \% (−20 \%), PM10 of −9 \% (−8 \%) and AOD of −11 \% (−14 \%). Discrepancies in the magnitude of simulated aerosol mass do not affect the ability of the model to reproduce the observed SSR trends. The positive change in observed European SSR (5 \%) during 1990–2009 ("brightening") is better reproduced by the model when aerosol radiative effects (ARE) are included (3 \%), compared to simulations where ARE are excluded (0.2 \%). The simulated top-of-the-atmosphere aerosol radiative forcing over Europe under all-sky conditions increased by {\textgreater} 3.0 W m−2 during the period 1970–2009 in response to changes in anthropogenic emissions and aerosol concentrations.},

We ﬁnd that the increased Asian emissions have had very little regional or global eﬀects, while the emission reductions in Europe and the U.S. have caused a positive radiative forcing. In our simulations, the global-mean aerosol direct radiative eﬀect changes by 0.06 W/m2 during 1996 to 2010, while the eﬀective radiative forcing (ERF) is 0.42 W/m2. The rather large ERF arises mainly from changes in cloudiness, especially in Europe. In Asia, the BC warming due to sunlight absorption has largely oﬀset the cooling caused by sulphate aerosols. Asian BC concentrations have increased by a nearly constant fraction at all altitudes, and thus, they warm the atmosphere also in cloudy conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract. We synthesised observations of total particle number (CN) concentration from 36 sites around the world. We found that annual mean CN concentrations are typically 300–2000 cm−3 in the marine boundary layer and free troposphere (FT) and 1000–10 000 cm−3 in the continental boundary layer (BL). Many sites exhibit pronounced seasonality with summer time concentrations a factor of 2–10 greater than wintertime concentrations. We used these CN observations to evaluate primary and secondary sources of particle number in a global aerosol microphysics model. We found that emissions of primary particles can reasonably reproduce the spatial pattern of observed CN concentration (R2=0.46) but fail to explain the observed seasonal cycle (R2=0.1). The modeled CN concentration in the FT was biased low (normalised mean bias, NMB=−88\%) unless a secondary source of particles was included, for example from binary homogeneous nucleation of sulfuric acid and water (NMB=−25\%). Simulated CN concentrations in the continental BL were also biased low (NMB=−74\%) unless the number emission of anthropogenic primary particles was increased or a mechanism that results in particle formation in the BL was included. We ran a number of simulations where we included an empirical BL nucleation mechanism either using the activation-type mechanism (nucleation rate, J, proportional to gas-phase sulfuric acid concentration to the power one) or kinetic-type mechanism (J proportional to sulfuric acid to the power two) with a range of nucleation coefficients. We found that the seasonal CN cycle observed at continental BL sites was better simulated by BL particle formation (R2=0.3) than by increasing the number emission from primary anthropogenic sources (R2=0.18). The nucleation constants that resulted in best overall match between model and observed CN concentrations were consistent with values derived in previous studies from detailed case studies at individual sites. In our model, kinetic and activation-type nucleation parameterizations gave similar agreement with observed monthly mean CN concentrations.},

	abstract = {Linear regression is used to examine the relationship between simulated changes in historical global-mean surface temperature (GMST) and global-mean aerosol effective radiative forcing (ERF) in 14 climate models from CMIP5. The models have global-mean aerosol ERF that ranges from 20.35 to 21.60 W m22 for 2000 relative to 1850. It is shown that aerosol ERF is the dominant factor that determines intermodel variations in simulated GMST change: correlations between aerosol ERF and simulated changes in GMST exceed 0.9 for linear trends in GMST over all periods that begin between 1860 and 1950 and end between 1995 and 2005. Comparison of modeled and observed GMST trends for these time periods gives an inferred global-mean aerosol ERF of 20.92 W m22. On average, transient climate sensitivity is roughly 40\% larger with respect to historical forcing from aerosols than well-mixed greenhouse gases. This enhanced sensitivity explains the dominant effect of aerosol forcing on simulated changes in GMST: it is estimated that 85\% of the intermodel variance of simulated GMST change is explained by variations in aerosol ERF, but without the enhanced sensitivity less than half would be explained. Physically, the enhanced sensitivity is caused by a combination of 1) the larger concentration of aerosol forcing in the midlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, where positive feedbacks are stronger and transient warming is faster than in the Southern Hemisphere, and 2) the time evolution of aerosol forcing, which levels out earlier than forcing from well-mixed greenhouse gases.},

	abstract = {Dimethylsulfide (DMS) is a sulfur-compound produced naturally in the sea. Once in the atmosphere, it is photooxidized to form non-sea-salt sulfate aerosols which affect the radiative budget indirectly as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). It has been postulated that the planet's climate may be modulated by variations in DMS production resulting from changes of the sea surface temperature (SST). It is shown that surface seawater DMS concentrations can be diagnosed at a near global scale using (1) satellite observations of Chl a, (2) climatological SSTs, (3) a temperature dependent index of the marine community structure and (4), observational relationships based on cruise data. This procedure is used to characterize the spatio-temporal variations in marine DMS emissions to the atmosphere in the Southern Hemisphere for the spring and summer months. Some coherence is obtained between DM5 emissions and the polarization measurements from the spaceborne POLDER instrument used to estimate the effective radius of liquid-phase clouds; higher are the DM5 emissions lower is the cloud droplet radius. An inspection of the ISCCP-D products of low-cloud optical depth and DM5 emissions at Amsterdam Island and Cape Grim indicates that higher are the DM5 emissions higher is the cloud optical depth. The IPSL ocean-atmosphere coupled model, which includes an explicit representation of plankton dynamics and Chl a, predicts significant large-scale changes of DM5 fluxes (from -20\% in the tropics to +20\% in the Southern Ocean for the zonal mean) in response to a doubling of atmospheric CO2. We envision that the decreased mass of sulfur in the tropical upper troposphere will lead to lower numbers of CCNs in the air subsiding back into the subtropical marine boundary layer.},

It is demonstrated that improvements within the new cloud microphysics scheme have the potential to substantially improve climate simulations. The new cloud microphysics scheme represents a realistic spatial distribution of the cloud fraction and LWCRF, particularly near the tropopause. The improvement in the cirrus cloud-top height by the new cloud microphysics scheme substantially reduces the warm bias in atmospheric temperature from the previous simulation via LWCRF by the cirrus clouds. The conversion rate of cloud ice to snow and gravitational sedimentation of cloud ice are the most important parameters for determining the strength of the radiative heating near the tropopause and its impact on atmospheric temperature.},

The coupling between the microphysics and the rest of the model is modiﬁed to make it more ﬂexible. Single-column tests show the new microphysics can simulate a constrained drizzling stratocumulus case. Substepping the cloud condensation (macrophysics) within a time step improves single-column results. Simulations of mixed-phase cases are strongly sensitive to ice nucleation. The new microphysics alters process rates in both single-column and global simulations, even at low (200 km) horizontal resolution. Thus, prognostic precipitation can be important, even in low-resolution simulations where advection of precipitation is not important. Accretion dominates as liquid water path increases in agreement with cloud-resolving model simulations and estimates from observations. The new microphysics with prognostic precipitation increases the ratio of accretion over autoconversion. The change in process rates appears to signiﬁcantly reduce aerosol–cloud interactions and indirect radiative effects of anthropogenic aerosols by up to 33\% (depending on substepping) to below 1 W m22 of cooling between simulations with preindustrial (1850) and present-day (2000) aerosol emissions.},

	abstract = {Measurements from actinic flux spectroradiometers on board the NASA DC-8 during the Atmospheric Tomography (ATom) mission provide an extensive set of statistics on how clouds alter photolysis rates (J values) throughout the remote Pacific and Atlantic Ocean basins. J values control tropospheric ozone and methane abundances, and thus clouds have been included for more than three decades in tropospheric chemistry modeling. ATom made four profiling circumnavigations of the troposphere capturing each of the seasons during 2016–2018. This work examines J values from the Pacific Ocean flights of the first deployment, but publishes the complete Atom-1 data set (29 July to 23 August 2016). We compare the observed J values (every 3\&thinsp;s along flight track) with those calculated by nine global chemistry–climate/transport models (globally gridded, hourly, for a mid-August day). To compare these disparate data sets, we build a commensurate statistical picture of the impact of clouds on J values using the ratio of J-cloudy (standard, sometimes cloudy conditions) to J-clear (artificially cleared of clouds). The range of modeled cloud effects is inconsistently large but they fall into two distinct classes: (1) models with large cloud effects showing mostly enhanced J values aloft and or diminished at the surface and (2) models with small effects having nearly clear-sky J values much of the time. The ATom-1 measurements generally favor large cloud effects but are not precise or robust enough to point out the best cloud-modeling approach. The models here have resolutions of 50–200\&thinsp;km and thus reduce the occurrence of clear sky when averaging over grid cells. In situ measurements also average scattered sunlight over a mixed cloud field, but only out to scales of tens of kilometers. A primary uncertainty remains in the role of clouds in chemistry, in particular, how models average over cloud fields, and how such averages can simulate measurements.},

	abstract = {Abstract Climate modes play an important role in weather and climate variability over multiple spatial and temporal scales. This research assesses Earth system model (ESM) projections of the spatiotemporal characteristics of key internal climate modes (NAM, SAM, PNA, ENSO, PDO, and AMO) under high (SSP585) and low (SSP126) radiative forcing scenarios and contextualizes those projections using historical fidelity. Time series analyses are used to assess trends and mode phase characteristics are summarized for the historical period and for the end of the twenty-first century. Spatial patterns are compared to infer morphological changes. Shifts in the power spectra are used to examine changes in variability at subannual, interannual, and interdecadal scales. Changes in time-lagged correlations are used to capture the evolution of first-order interactions. While differences in historical skill are predominantly ESM dependent, changing mode characteristics in a warmer climate also exhibit variability between individual ensemble realizations. NAM, SAM, and ENSO tend to evolve toward increased prevalence of the positive phase up to 2100 across the multimodel ensemble while the PNA and PDO exhibit little trend but increasing phase intensity. AMO characteristics are shown to depend on the method used to remove the external signal. ESMs that show higher historical fidelity tend to show more modest changes in those modes under global nonstationarity. Changes in mode interactions are found to be highly ESM dependent but exhibit broadly similar behavior to historical relationships. These findings have implications for our understanding of internal variability and make clear that the choice of ESM, and even the ESM realization, matters for applications of climate projections. Significance Statement Internal modes of variability are important to understand due to their impact on local, regional, and global weather and climate patterns. Future climate changes will not only be affected by the variability arising from these modes, but the modes will themselves change in response to the changing climate. Spatial and temporal aspects of the modes are assessed from projections of future climate and related to how well they are captured in the historical climate. This yields some measure of confidence in the changes exhibited by the models. In most cases, when historically skillful models exhibit changes that are different from those produced by less skillful models, they tend to produce more modest changes. These results, as well as the variability between model outcomes, mean decisions on which ESM to use for projections of the future climate matter significantly.},

Two previous modelling studies suggested the volcanic fraction of sulphate was 18\% and 35\%, from sources representing 7\% and 14\%, respectively, of the global total SO2 emission.

	abstract = {The process by which sulphur dioxide is oxidised in atmospheric droplets has been studied in laboratory experiments designed to collect a large amount of chemical data pertinent to the atmospheric situation. Thus the oxidation of sodium sulphite solutions by oxygen, ozone and hydrogen peroxide has been studied at different pH's and temperatures. In all cases the reaction is first order with respect to sulphite ion but the order with respect to oxidant differs. For oxygen the order is zero whereas the order for ozone and hydrogen peroxide is one. Varying the hydrogen ion concentration has little effect on the oxygen reaction rate between pH 6 and 9; the ozone reaction rate is inversely proportional to the square root of the hydrogen ion concentration and the hydrogen peroxide rate is almost directly proportional to the hydrogen ion concentration. These last two observations are very important since in the case of ozone it indicates that the reaction proceeds via a free radical mechanism involving hydroxyl radicals and in the case of hydrogen peroxide it is the only oxidation process of sodium sulphite so far investigated that shows a positive response to the presence of hydrogen ions. The experimental data was used to calculate the rate of sulphate formation in water droplets under atmospheric conditions for each of the three oxidants. If it is assumed that the ozone and hydrogen peroxide gas phase concentrations are initially 50 parts in 109 and 1 part in 109 by volume respectively, then the rates of sulphate formation are equal in cloud water at pH 5.8. Above this pH the ozone reaction is faster and below it the hydrogen peroxide reaction is faster due to the positive catalysis by hydrogen ions; the oxygen rate is unimportant by comparison at all pH's below 7. The rate of hydrogen peroxide reaction is such that substantial amounts of sulphate can still be formed rapidly in water droplets at pH values from 3 to 5, and thus this process will be very important in creating acidity in rainwater.},

	abstract = {The global distributions of sulfate and soot particles in the atmosphere are calculated, and the effect of aerosol particles on tropospheric oxidants is studied using a global chemical/transport/aerosol model. The model is developed in the framework of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) global three-dimensional chemical/transport model (Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers (MOZART)). In addition to the gas-phase photochemistry implemented in the MOZART model, the present study also accounts for the formation of sulfate and black carbon aerosols as well as for heterogeneous reactions on particles. The simulated global sulfate aerosol distributions and seasonal variation are compared with observations. The seasonal variation of sulfate aerosols is in agreement with measurements, except in the Arctic region. The calculated vertical profiles of sulfate aerosol agree well with the observations over North America. In the case of black carbon the calculated surface distribution is in fair agreement with observations. The effects of aerosol formation and heterogeneous reactions on the surface of sulfate aerosols are studied. The model calculations show the following: (1) The concentration of H2O2 is reduced when sulfate aerosols are formed due to the reaction of SO2 + H2O2 in cloud droplets. The gas-phase reaction SO2 + OH converts OH to HO2, but the reduction of OH and enhancement of HO2 are insignificant ({\textless}3\%). (2) The heterogeneous reaction of HO2 on the surface of sulfate aerosols produces up to 10\% reduction of hydroperoxyl radical (HO2) with an uptake coefficient of 0.2. However, this uptake coefficient could be overestimated, and the results should be regard as an upper limit estimation. (3) The N2O5 reaction on the surface of sulfate aerosols leads to an 80\% reduction of NOx at middle to high latitudes during winter. Because ozone production efficiency is low in winter, ozone decreases by only 10\% as a result of this reaction. However, during summer the N2O5 reaction reduces NOx by 15\% and O3 by 8–10\% at middle to high latitudes. (4) The heterogeneous reaction of CH2O on sulfate aerosols with an upper limit uptake coefficient (γ = 0.01) leads to an 80 to 90\% decrease in CH2O and 8 to 10\% reduction of HO2 at middle to high latitudes during winter. Many uncertainties remain in our understanding of heterogeneous chemical processes and in the estimate of kinetic parameters. This model study should therefore be regarded as exploratory and subject to further improvements before final conclusions can be made.},

	abstract = {Cloud drop condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN) particles determine to a large extent cloud microstructure and, consequently, cloud albedo and the dynamic response of clouds to aerosol-induced changes to precipitation. This can modify the reflected solar radiation and the thermal radiation emitted to space. Measurements of tropospheric CCN and IN over large areas have not been possible and can be only roughly approximated from satellite-sensor-based estimates of optical properties of aerosols. Our lack of ability to measure both CCN and cloud updrafts precludes disentangling the effects of meteorology from those of aerosols and represents the largest component in our uncertainty in anthropogenic climate forcing. Ways to improve the retrieval accuracy include multiangle and multipolarimetric passive measurements of the optical signal and multispectral lidar polarimetric measurements. Indirect methods include proxies of trace gases, as retrieved by hyperspectral sensors. Perhaps the most promising emerging direction is retrieving the CCN properties by simultaneously retrieving convective cloud drop number concentrations and updraft speeds, which amounts to using clouds as natural CCN chambers. These satellite observations have to be constrained by in situ observations of aerosol-cloud-precipitation-climate (ACPC) interactions, which in turn constrain a hierarchy of model simulations of ACPC. Since the essence of a general circulation model is an accurate quantification of the energy and mass fluxes in all forms between the surface, atmosphere and outer space, a route to progress is proposed here in the form of a series of box flux closure experiments in the various climate regimes. A roadmap is provided for quantifying the ACPC interactions and thereby reducing the uncertainty in anthropogenic climate forcing.},

	abstract = {The IMPACT global chemistry and transport model has been updated to include an aerosol dynamics module. Here it is used to simulate the dynamics of sulfate aerosol and its interaction with nonsulfate aerosol components: carbonaceous aerosol (organic matter (OM) and black carbon (BC)), dust, and sea salt. The sulfate aerosol dynamics is based on the method of modes and moments. In the current implementation, two modes are used for sulfate aerosol (nuclei and accumulation mode), and two moments are predicted within each mode (sulfate aerosol number and mass concentration). The aging of carbonaceous aerosol and dust particles from hydrophobic to hydrophilic depends on the surface coating of sulfate which occurs as a result of the condensation of sulfuric acid gas H2SO4 (g) on their surface, and coagulation with pure sulfate aerosol. The model predicts high sulfate aerosol number concentrations in the nuclei mode (over 104 cm−3) in the tropical upper troposphere, while accumulation mode sulfate number concentrations are generally within 50–500 cm−3 in most parts of the free troposphere. The model predicted mass concentrations of sulfate, OM, BC, dust, and sea salt, H2SO4 (g) concentration, aerosol number, and size distributions are compared with measurement data. Our model predicts ∼80\% of global sulfate existing as a pure sulfate aerosol (9.7\% in nuclei and 69.8\% in accumulation mode), with 14.3\% on carbonaceous aerosol, 3.3\% on dust, and 2.7\% on sea salt. In the boundary layer, over 40\% of sulfate is associated with nonsulfate aerosols in many regions of the world whereas less than 10\% of sulfate is associated with nonsulfate aerosols in the upper troposphere. The model predicted mass fraction of sulfate in the sulfate-carbonaceous aerosol mixture suggests that carbonaceous aerosol in most of the troposphere is internally mixed with sulfate and thus generally hygroscopic except near the source regions where the mass fraction is less than 5\%. On the global mean, 54\% and 93\% of carbonaceous aerosol are coated with sulfate in the boundary layer and in the upper troposphere, respectively. Our result suggests that carbonaceous aerosols have a shorter lifetime (3∼4 days) than predicted (4∼8 days) using models that treat these aerosols as partly hydrophobic with an arbitrary e-folding time from hydrophobic to hydrophilic.},

This chapter focuses on process understanding and considers observations, theory and models to assess how clouds and aerosols contribute and respond to climate change. The following conclusions are drawn.Progress in UnderstandingMany of the cloudiness and humidity changes simulated by climate models in warmer climates are now understood as responses to large-scale circulation changes that do not appear to depend strongly on sub-grid scale model processes, increasing confidence in these changes. For example, multiple lines of evidence now indicate positive feedback contributions from circulation-driven changes in both the height of high clouds and the latitudinal distribution of clouds (medium to high confidence). However, some aspects of the overall cloud response vary substantially among models, and these appear to depend strongly on sub-grid scale processes in which there is less confidence. \{7.2.4, 7.2.5, 7.2.6, Figure 7.11\}Climate-relevant aerosol processes are better understood, and climate-relevant aerosol properties better observed, than at the time of AR4. However, the representation of relevant processes varies greatly in global aerosol and climate models and it remains unclear what level of sophistication is required to model their effect on climate. Globally, between 20 and 40\% of aerosol optical depth (medium confidence) and between one quarter and two thirds of cloud condensation nucleus concentrations (low confidence) are of anthropogenic origin.},

The method is simply to regress the top of atmosphere radiative flux against the global average surface air temperature change. This method does not require special integrations or off-line estimates, such as for stratospheric adjustment, to obtain the forcing, and eliminates the need for double radiation calculations and tropopause radiative fluxes. We show that for CO2 and solar forcing in a slab model and an AOGCM the method gives results consistent with those obtained by conventional methods. For a single integration it is less precise but since it does not require a steady state to be reached its precision could be improved by running an ensemble of short integrations.},

	abstract = {An assessment of global particulate nitrate and ammonium aerosol based on simulations from nine models participating in the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) phase III study is presented. A budget analysis was conducted to understand the typical magnitude, distribution, and diversity of the aerosols and their precursors among the models. To gain confidence regarding model performance, the model results were evaluated with various observations globally, including ground station measurements over North America, Europe, and east Asia for tracer concentrations and dry and wet depositions, as well as with aircraft measurements in the Northern Hemisphere mid-to-high latitudes for tracer vertical distributions. Given the unique chemical and physical features of the nitrate occurrence, we further investigated the similarity and differentiation among the models by examining (1) the pH-dependent NH3 wet deposition; (2) the nitrate formation via heterogeneous chemistry on the surface of dust and sea salt particles or thermodynamic equilibrium calculation including dust and sea salt ions; and (3) the nitrate coarse-mode fraction (i.e., coarse/total). It is found that HNO3, which is simulated explicitly based on full O3-HOx-NOx-aerosol chemistry by all models, differs by up to a factor of 9 among the models in its global tropospheric burden. This partially contributes to a large difference in NO3−, whose atmospheric burden differs by up to a factor of 13. The atmospheric burdens of NH3 and NH4+ differ by 17 and 4, respectively. Analyses at the process level show that the large diversity in atmospheric burdens of NO3−, NH3, and NH4+ is also related to deposition processes. Wet deposition seems to be the dominant process in determining the diversity in NH3 and NH4+ lifetimes. It is critical to correctly account for contributions of heterogeneous chemical production of nitrate on dust and sea salt, because this process overwhelmingly controls atmospheric nitrate production (typically \&gt; 80 \%) and determines the coarse- and fine-mode distribution of nitrate aerosol.},

In this study, the global climate model NCAR CESM1 (National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Earth System Model version 1.2) is used in coupled atmosphere–slab ocean mode to simulate the global hydrological-cycle response to a fixed amount and composition of aerosol emitted from eight key source regions. The results indicate that the location of aerosol emissions is a strong determinant of both the magnitude and spatial distribution of the hydrological response. The global-mean precipitation response to aerosol emissions is found to vary over a 6-fold range depending solely on source location. Mid-latitude sources generate larger global-mean precipitation responses than do tropical and sub-tropical sources, driven largely by the former's stronger global-mean temperature influence. However, the spatial distribution of precipitation responses to some (largely tropical and sub-tropical) regional emissions is almost entirely localized within the source region, while responses to other (primarily mid-latitude) regional emissions are almost entirely remote. It is proposed that this diversity arises from the differing strength with which each region's emissions generate fast precipitation responses that remain largely localized. The findings highlight that tropical regions are particularly susceptible to hydrological-cycle change from either local or remote aerosol emissions, encourage greater investigation of the processes controlling localization of the precipitation response to regional aerosols, and demonstrate that the geographic distribution of anthropogenic aerosol emissions must be considered when estimating their hydrological impacts.},

Understanding surface energy flux changes, a crucial pathway by which atmospheric forcing is communicated to the ocean, is a vital bridge to explaining the similar full atmosphere-and-ocean responses to these disparate forcings. Here we analyze the fast, atmosphere-driven change in surface energy flux caused by present-day greenhouse gases vs aerosols to elucidate its role in shaping the subsequent slow, coupled response. We find that the surface energy flux response patterns achieve roughly two-thirds of the anti-correlation seen in the fully coupled response, driven by Rossby waves excited by symmetric changes to the land–sea contrast. Our results suggest that atmosphere and land surface processes are capable of achieving substantial within-hemisphere homogenization in the climate response to disparate forcers on fast, societally-relevant timescales.},

These temperature effects may be beneficial but are almost certainly overwhelmed by aerosols’ negative health impacts3. Recent analyses of economic impacts have concluded that warming harms economies in warm climates, but provides economic benefits in cold climates4. Here we investigate whether aerosol-induced cooling would have a positive effect on less wealthy economies in hotter regions and a negative effect on wealthier economies in colder regions. Climate simulations over the historical period both with and without anthropogenic aerosol emissions, using a fully coupled ocean and atmosphere climate model, indicate that in year 2010 anthropogenic aerosol emissions were cooling the Earth by 0.72 ± 0.02 °C relative to a scenario without such emissions. Due to opposing economic impacts in different regions, the net economic impact of aerosol-induced cooling is likely to be small at the global scale. However, these results suggest that the cooling effects of anthropogenic aerosols benefit developing tropical economies while harming developed high-latitude economies, and thus the temperature effects of past aerosol emissions have probably diminished global economic inequality.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates immersion mode ice nucleating particle (INP) concentrations measured with a continuous flow diffusion chamber (CFDC) at temperatures of −20, −25, and −30 °C in Beijing from May 4 to June 4, 2018. Aerosol conditions in the experiment period are classified into four types: clean, light PM2.5 pollution, heavy PM2.5 pollution, and dust. The PM mass concentrations and the aerosol size distributions are distinctly different in the four aerosol conditions. INP concentration increases as temperature decreases from −20 to −30 °C for all the four aerosol conditions. At a given temperature, INP concentrations progressively increase as the aerosol condition changes from clean to light PM2.5 pollution and to heavy PM2.5 pollution condition. At −25 and −30 °C, the dust condition has a much higher INP concentration than the other aerosol conditions. The INP concentration is closely related to the number concentration of aerosols with diameters of 1.0–2.5 μm (𝑛1.0). Using a similar method as in the previous parameterization of INP concentrations for global and fairly clean aerosol conditions, a new parameterization of the INP concentration based on 𝑛1.0 is provided for the complicated aerosol conditions with high aerosol number concentrations in Beijing.},

The 16 ACCMIP models have a wide range of horizontal and vertical resolutions, vertical extent, chemistry schemes and interaction with radiation and clouds. While anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions were specified for all time slices in the ACCMIP protocol, it is found that the natural emissions are responsible for a significant range across models, mostly in the case of ozone precursors. The analysis of selected present-day climate diagnostics (precipitation, temperature, specific humidity and zonal wind) reveals biases consistent with state-of-the-art climate models. The model-to-model comparison of changes in temperature, specific humidity and zonal wind between 1850 and 2000 and between 2000 and 2100 indicates mostly consistent results.

We find that the time history of aerosol ERFs diagnosed in CMIP6 models exhibits considerable variation and explore how the time history of aerosol forcing influences the probability distributions of present-day aerosol forcing and emergent metrics such as climate sensitivity. Using a simple energy balance model, trained on CMIP6 climate models and constrained by observed near-surface warming and ocean heat uptake, we derive estimates for the historical aerosol forcing. We find 2005–2014 mean aerosol ERF to be −1.1 (−1.8 to −0.5) W m−2 relative to 1750. Assuming recently published historical emissions from fossil fuel and industrial sectors and biomass burning emissions from SSP2-4.5, aerosol ERF in 2019 is −0.9 (−1.5 to −0.4) W m−2. There is a modest recovery in aerosol forcing (+0.025 W m−2 decade−1) between 1980 and 2014. This analysis also gives a 5\%–95\% range of equilibrium climate sensitivity of 1.8°C –5.1°C (best estimate 3.1°C) with a transient climate response of 1.2°C –2.6°C (best estimate 1.8°C).},

Climate model simulations with fixed sea surface temperatures but perturbed atmospheric aerosol loadings allow for an estimate of how strongly the planet\&rsquo;s radiative energy budget has been perturbed by the increase in aerosols since pre-industrial times. The approximate partial radiative perturbation (APRP) technique further decomposes the contributions to the direct forcing from aerosol scattering and absorption, and to the indirect forcing from aerosol-induced changes in cloud scattering, amount, and absorption, as well as the effects of aerosols on surface albedo. Here we evaluate previously published APRP-derived estimates of aerosol effective radiative forcings from these simulations and find that they are slightly biased as a result of large but compensating errors. These biases are largest for the aerosol direct effect owing to underestimated aerosol absorption. Correcting these biases eliminates the residuals and leads to better agreement with ground-truth estimates derived from double-calls to the radiation code. The APRP method \&ndash; when properly implemented \&ndash; remains a highly accurate and efficient technique for diagnosing aerosol ERF in cases where double radiation calls are not available, and in all cases it provides quantification of the individual contributors to the ERF that are highly useful but not otherwise available.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Abstract The Community Earth System Model with marine and terrestrial biogeochemistry is configured to simulate glacial climate. The integration shows transitions from warm to cold states—interstadials to stadials—and back. The amplitude of the associated Greenland and Antarctica temperature changes and the atmospheric CO2 signal are consistent with ice-core reconstructions, and so are the time lags between termination of a stadial, Antarctic temperature reversal, and the decline of the atmospheric CO2 concentration (for brevity’s sake simply referred to as CO2 from here on). The present model results stand out because the transitions occur spontaneously (without forcing changes like hosing) and because they reproduce the observed features above in a configuration that uses the same parameterizations as climate simulations for the present day (i.e., no retuning has been done). During stadials, precipitation shifts lead to reduced growth on land, which dominates the CO2 increase; the ocean acts as a minor carbon sink during the stadials. After the end of the stadials, however, the sudden reversal of the stadial anomalies in temperature, wind, and precipitation turns the ocean into a carbon source, which accounts for the continued rise of CO2 for several hundred years into the interstadial. The simulations also provide a novel possible interpretation for the observed correlation between CO2 and Antarctic temperature: rather than both being controlled by Southern Ocean processes, they are both controlled by the North Atlantic Ocean, and most of the extra CO2 may not be of Southern Hemisphere origin. If the stadials are prolonged through North Atlantic hosing, the upper ocean comes to an equilibrium, and the CO2 response is dominated by a single process: reduced export production in the North Atlantic as result of the collapsed overturning circulation. This is in contrast to the unforced simulation where the net ocean carbon flux anomaly is the sum of several regional responses of both signs and similar magnitudes. Reducing the aeolian iron deposition by half, to account for the observed reduction of Southern Hemisphere dust fluxes during stadials, reduces biological productivity and export production so that the Southern Ocean emerges as an important carbon source, at least for the three centuries up until a new equilibrium for the upper ocean is reached. Significance Statement The last ice age featured millennial-scale oscillations in CO2 and temperature, the latter being anticorrelated between Greenland and Antarctica. This is often referred to as the bipolar seesaw. Here, an Earth system model is described that reproduces these signals, and its results are used to explain the observed correlation between temperature and CO2. In contrast to previous idealized studies it is found that all ocean basins and the land each contribute equally to the CO2 signal.},

If plausible, these models require substantially larger greenhouse gas reductions to meet global warming targets. We show that models with a more positive cloud feedback also have a stronger cooling effect from aerosol-cloud interactions. These two effects offset each other during the historical period when both aerosols and greenhouse gases increase, allowing either more positive or neutral cloud feedback models to reproduce the observed global-mean temperature change. Since anthropogenic aerosols primarily concentrate in the Northern Hemisphere, strong aerosol-cloud interaction models produce an interhemispheric asymmetric warming.

	abstract = {Aerosol radiative forcing and cloud–climate feedbacks each have a large effect on climate, mainly through modification of solar short-wave radiative fluxes. Here we determine what causes the long-term trends in the upwelling short-wave (SW) top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) fluxes (FSW↑) over the North Atlantic region. Coupled atmosphere–ocean simulations from the UK Earth System Model (UKESM1) and the Hadley Centre General Environment Model (HadGEM3-GC3.1) show a positive FSW↑ trend between 1850 and 1970 (increasing SW reflection) and a negative trend between 1970 and 2014. We find that the 1850–1970 positive FSW↑ trend is mainly driven by an increase in cloud droplet number concentration due to increases in aerosol, while the 1970–2014 trend is mainly driven by a decrease in cloud fraction, which we attribute mainly to cloud feedbacks caused by greenhouse gas-induced warming. In the 1850–1970 period, aerosol-induced cooling and greenhouse gas warming roughly counteract each other, so the temperature-driven cloud feedback effect on the FSW↑ trend is weak (contributing to only 23 \% of the ΔFSW↑), and aerosol forcing is the dominant effect (77 \% of ΔFSW↑). However, in the 1970–2014 period the warming from greenhouse gases intensifies, and the cooling from aerosol radiative forcing reduces, resulting in a large overall warming and a reduction in FSW↑ that is mainly driven by cloud feedbacks (87 \% of ΔFSW↑). The results suggest that it is difficult to use satellite observations in the post-1970 period to evaluate and constrain the magnitude of the aerosol–cloud interaction forcing but that cloud feedbacks might be evaluated.

 Comparisons with observations between 1985 and 2014 show that the simulated reduction in FSW↑ and the increase in temperature are too strong. However, the temperature discrepancy can account for only part of the FSW↑ discrepancy given the estimated model feedback strength (λ=∂FSW∂T). The remaining discrepancy suggests a model bias in either λ or in the strength of the aerosol forcing (aerosols are reducing during this time period) to explain the too-strong decrease in FSW↑, with a λ bias being the most likely. Both of these biases would also tend to cause too-large an increase in temperature over the 1985–2014 period, which would be consistent with the sign of the model temperature bias reported here. Either of these model biases would have important implications for future climate projections using these models.},

	abstract = {Abstract We describe the historical evolution of the conceptualization, formulation, quantification, application, and utilization of “radiative forcing” (RF) of Earth’s climate. Basic theories of shortwave and longwave radiation were developed through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and established the analytical framework for defining and quantifying the perturbations to Earth’s radiative energy balance by natural and anthropogenic influences. The insight that Earth’s climate could be radiatively forced by changes in carbon dioxide, first introduced in the nineteenth century, gained empirical support with sustained observations of the atmospheric concentrations of the gas beginning in 1957. Advances in laboratory and field measurements, theory, instrumentation, computational technology, data, and analysis of well-mixed greenhouse gases and the global climate system through the twentieth century enabled the development and formalism of RF; this allowed RF to be related to changes in global-mean surface temperature with the aid of increasingly sophisticated models. This in turn led to RF becoming firmly established as a principal concept in climate science by 1990. The linkage with surface temperature has proven to be the most important application of the RF concept, enabling a simple metric to evaluate the relative climate impacts of different agents. The late 1970s and 1980s saw accelerated developments in quantification, including the first assessment of the effect of the forcing due to the doubling of carbon dioxide on climate (the “Charney” report). The concept was subsequently extended to a wide variety of agents beyond well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHGs; carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and halocarbons) to short-lived species such as ozone. The WMO and IPCC international assessments began the important sequence of periodic evaluations and quantifications of the forcings by natural (solar irradiance changes and stratospheric aerosols resulting from volcanic eruptions) and a growing set of anthropogenic agents (WMGHGs, ozone, aerosols, land surface changes, contrails). From the 1990s to the present, knowledge and scientific confidence in the radiative agents acting on the climate system have proliferated. The conceptual basis of RF has also evolved as both our understanding of the way radiative forcing drives climate change and the diversity of the forcing mechanisms have grown. This has led to the current situation where “effective radiative forcing” (ERF) is regarded as the preferred practical definition of radiative forcing in order to better capture the link between forcing and global-mean surface temperature change. The use of ERF, however, comes with its own attendant issues, including challenges in its diagnosis from climate models, its applications to small forcings, and blurring of the distinction between rapid climate adjustments (fast responses) and climate feedbacks; this will necessitate further elaboration of its utility in the future. Global climate model simulations of radiative perturbations by various agents have established how the forcings affect other climate variables besides temperature (e.g., precipitation). The forcing–response linkage as simulated by models, including the diversity in the spatial distribution of forcings by the different agents, has provided a practical demonstration of the effectiveness of agents in perturbing the radiative energy balance and causing climate changes. The significant advances over the past half century have established, with very high confidence, that the global-mean ERF due to human activity since preindustrial times is positive (the 2013 IPCC assessment gives a best estimate of 2.3 W m−2, with a range from 1.1 to 3.3 W m−2; 90\% confidence interval). Further, except in the immediate aftermath of climatically significant volcanic eruptions, the net anthropogenic forcing dominates over natural radiative forcing mechanisms. Nevertheless, the substantial remaining uncertainty in the net anthropogenic ERF leads to large uncertainties in estimates of climate sensitivity from observations and in predicting future climate impacts. The uncertainty in the ERF arises principally from the incorporation of the rapid climate adjustments in the formulation, the well-recognized difficulties in characterizing the preindustrial state of the atmosphere, and the incomplete knowledge of the interactions of aerosols with clouds. This uncertainty impairs the quantitative evaluation of climate adaptation and mitigation pathways in the future. A grand challenge in Earth system science lies in continuing to sustain the relatively simple essence of the radiative forcing concept in a form similar to that originally devised, and at the same time improving the quantification of the forcing. This, in turn, demands an accurate, yet increasingly complex and comprehensive, accounting of the relevant processes in the climate system.},

However, via their climate impact, SLCFs can affect carbon sinks and atmospheric CO2, causing additional climate change. Here, we use a compact Earth system model to attribute CO2 RF to direct CO2 emissions and to climate–carbon feedbacks since the pre-industrial era. We estimate the climate–carbon feedback contributed 93 ± 50 mW m−2 ({\textasciitilde}5\%) to total RF of CO2 in 2010. Of this, SLCF impacts were −13 ± 50 mW m−2, made up of cooling (−115 ± 43 mW m−2) and warming (102 ± 26 mW m−2) terms that largely cancel. This study illustrates the long-term impact that short-lived species have on climate and indicates that past (and future) change in atmospheric CO2 cannot be attributed only to CO2 emissions.},

While observationally derived constraints exist for global annual mean present-day OH abundances and interannual variability, OH estimates for past and future periods rely primarily on global atmospheric chemistry models. These models disagree ± 30\% in mean OH and in its changes from the preindustrial to late 21st century, even when forced with identical anthropogenic emissions. A simple steady-state relationship that accounts for ozone photolysis frequencies, water vapor, and the ratio of reactive nitrogen to carbon emissions explains temporal variability within most models, but not intermodel differences. Here, we show that departure from the expected relationship reflects the treatment of reactive oxidized nitrogen species (NOy) and the fraction of emitted carbon that reacts within each chemical mechanism, which remain poorly known due to a lack of observational data. Our findings imply a need for additional observational constraints on NOy partitioning and lifetime, especially in the remote free troposphere, as well as the fate of carbon-containing reaction intermediates to test models, thereby reducing uncertainties in projections of OH and, hence, lifetimes of pollutants and greenhouse gases.},

	abstract = {Decadal trends and interannual variations in the hydroxyl radical (OH), while poorly constrained at present, are critical for understanding the observed evolution of atmospheric methane (CH4). Through analyzing the OH fields simulated by the model ensemble of the Chemistry–Climate Model Initiative (CCMI), we find (1) the negative OH anomalies during the El Niño years mainly corresponding to the enhanced carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from biomass burning and (2) a positive OH trend during 1980–2010 dominated by the elevated primary production and the reduced loss of OH due to decreasing CO after 2000. Both two-box model inversions and variational 4D inversions suggest that ignoring the negative anomaly of OH during the El Niño years leads to a large overestimation of the increase in global CH4 emissions by up to 10\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;3\&thinsp;Tg\&thinsp;yr−1 to match the observed CH4 increase over these years. Not accounting for the increasing OH trends given by the CCMI models leads to an underestimation of the CH4 emission increase by 23\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;9\&thinsp;Tg\&thinsp;yr−1 from 1986 to 2010. The variational-inversion-estimated CH4 emissions show that the tropical regions contribute most to the uncertainties related to OH. This study highlights the significant impact of climate and chemical feedbacks related to OH on the top-down estimates of the global CH4 budget.},

	abstract = {TROPOSPHERIC aerosols are thought to have three important effects on the Earth's radiation budget: the direct radiative effect1 (pertur-bation of clear-sky reflectivity), the indirect radiative effect2 (modi-fication of cloud albedo) and the effect on the hydrological cycle3 (modification of the vertical thickness and horizontal extent of clouds). The first two effects have been understood in principle for nearly 20 years, and quantitative estimates of their magnitudes have been provided by models and observations4. The third phe-nomenon, and its relation to the other two, has received far less attention. Previous work3 has shown, however, that increases in aerosol concentration may act to increase cloud albedo by increas-ing horizontal cloud fraction as well as cloud reflectivity. Here we use a simple model of the marine cloud-topped boundary layer to investigate the changes in cloud thickness and albedo that result from changes in precipitation as particle concentrations vary. We find that the sensitivity of layer cloud albedo to droplet number concentration (the albedo susceptibility) is increased by 50–200\% when the dependence of cloud thickness on particle number is included. The results suggest that the response of cloud thickness to changes in aerosol particle concentration must be taken into account for accurate prediction of global albedo by climate models.},

We find little changes in the aerosol ERF for 1970–2014 in the CMIP6 multi-model mean, which implies greenhouse gases primarily explain the positive trend in the total anthropogenic ERF. Cloud-mediated effects dominate the present-day aerosol ERF in most models. The results highlight a regional increase in marine cloudiness due to aerosols, despite suppressed cloud lifetime effects in that RFMIP-SpAer experiment. Negative cloud-mediated effects mask positive direct effects in many models, which arise from strong anthropogenic aerosol absorption. The findings suggest opportunities to better constrain simulated ERF by revisiting the optical properties and long-range transport of aerosols.},

The inter-model differences in tropospheric OH burden and vertical distributions are mainly determined by the differences in the nitrogen oxide (NO) distributions, while the spatial discrepancies between OH fields are mostly due to differences in natural emissions and volatile organic compound (VOC) chemistry.

Microphysical processes simulated are homogeneous nucleation, condensation and evaporation, coagulation, and sedimentation. Tropospheric aerosols are removed by washout processes and by surface deposition. We assume that all aerosols are strictly binary water-sulfuric acid solutions without solid cores. The main source of condensation nuclei for the stratosphere is new particle formation by homogeneous nucleation in the upper tropical troposphere. A signficant finding is that the stratospheric aerosol mass may be strongly influenced by deep convection in the troposphere. This process, which could transport gas-phase sulfate precursors into the upper troposphere and lead to elevated levels of SO2 there, could potentially double the stratospheric aerosol mass relative to that due to OCS photooxidation alone. Our model is successful at reproducing the magnitude of stratospheric aerosol loading following the Mount Pinatubo eruption, but the calculated rate of decay of aerosols from the stratosphere is faster than that derived from observations.},

	abstract = {RECENT measurements of inorganic chlorine gases1 and hydrocarbons2 indicate the presence of reactive chlorine in the remote marine boundary layer; reactions involving chlorine and bromine can affect the concentrations of ozone, hydrocarbons and cloud condensation nuclei. The known formation mechanisms of reactive halogens require significant concentrations of nitrogen oxides3–5, which are not present in the unpolluted air of the remote marine boundary layer6. Here we propose an autocatalytic mechanism for halogen release from sea-salt aerosol: gaseous HOBr is scavenged by the aerosol and converted to only slightly soluble BrCl and Br2, which are released into the gas phase. Depending on the sea-salt concentration and given a boundary layer that is stable for a few days, gaseous HOCl and HOBr may reach molar mixing ratios of up to 35 pmol mol−1. We calculate that HOBr and HOCl are responsible for 20\% and 40\%, respectively, of the sulphur (IV) oxidation7,8 that occurs in the aerosol phase. The additional S(IV) oxidation reduces the formation of cloud-condensation nuclei, and hence the feedback between greenhouse warming, oceanic DMS emission and cloud albedo. We also calculate significant bromine-catalysed ozone loss.},

	abstract = {A GLObal Model of Aerosol Processes (GLOMAP) has been developed as an extension to the TOMCAT 3-D Eulerian off-line chemical transport model. GLOMAP simulates the evolution of the global aerosol size distribution using a sectional two-moment scheme and includes the processes of aerosol nucleation, condensation, growth, coagulation, wet and dry deposition and cloud processing. We describe the results of a global simulation of sulfuric acid and sea spray aerosol. The model captures features of the aerosol size distribution that are well established from observations in the marine boundary layer and free troposphere. Modelled condensation nuclei (CN\&gt;3nm) vary between about 250\&ndash;500 cm-3 in remote marine boundary layer regions and are generally in good agreement with observations. Modelled continental CN concentrations are lower than observed, which may be due to lack of some primary aerosol sources or the neglect of nucleation mechanisms other than binary homogeneous nucleation of sulfuric acid-water particles. Remote marine CN concentrations increase to around 2000\&ndash;10 000 cm (at standard temperature and pressure) in the upper troposphere, which agrees with typical observed vertical profiles. Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) at 0.2\% supersaturation vary between about 1000 cm-3 in polluted regions and between 10 and 500 cm-3 in the remote marine boundary layer. New particle formation through sulfuric acid-water binary nucleation occurs predominantly in the upper troposphere, but the model results show that these particles contribute greatly to aerosol concentrations in the marine boundary layer. For this sulfur-sea salt system it is estimated that sea spray emissions account for only {\textasciitilde}10\% of CCN in the tropical marine boundary layer, but between 20 and 75\% in the mid-latitude Southern Ocean. In a run with only natural sulfate and sea salt emissions the global mean surface CN concentration is more than 60\% of that from a run with 1985 anthropogenic sulfur emissions, although the natural emissions comprise only 27\% of total sulfur emissions. Southern hemisphere marine boundary layer CN are more than 90\% natural in origin, while polluted continental CN are more than 90\% anthropogenic in origin, although these numbers will change when other anthropogenic CN sources are included in the model.},

	abstract = {Radiative forcing (RF) time series for total ozone from 1850 up to the present day are calculated based on historical simulations of ozone from 10 climate models contributing to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). In addition, RF is calculated for ozone fields prepared as an input for CMIP6 models without chemistry schemes and from a chemical transport model simulation. A radiative kernel for ozone is constructed and used to derive the RF. The ozone RF in 2010 (2005–2014) relative to 1850 is 0.35 W m−2 [0.08–0.61] (5–95\% uncertainty range) based on models with both tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry. One of these models has a negative present-day total ozone RF. Excluding this model, the present-day ozone RF increases to 0.39 W m−2 [0.27–0.51] (5–95\% uncertainty range). The rest of the models have RF close to or stronger than the RF time series assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in the fifth assessment report with the primary driver likely being the new precursor emissions used in CMIP6. The rapid adjustments beyond stratospheric temperature are estimated to be weak and thus the RF is a good measure of effective radiative forcing.},

	abstract = {We document the development of the first version of the U.K. Earth System Model UKESM1. The model represents a major advance on its predecessor HadGEM2-ES, with enhancements to all component models and new feedback mechanisms. These include a new core physical model with a well-resolved stratosphere; terrestrial biogeochemistry with coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles and enhanced land management; tropospheric-stratospheric chemistry allowing the holistic simulation of radiative forcing from ozone, methane, and nitrous oxide; two-moment, five-species, modal aerosol; and ocean biogeochemistry with two-way coupling to the carbon cycle and atmospheric aerosols. The complexity of coupling between the ocean, land, and atmosphere physical climate and biogeochemical cycles in UKESM1 is unprecedented for an Earth system model. We describe in detail the process by which the coupled model was developed and tuned to achieve acceptable performance in key physical and Earth system quantities and discuss the challenges involved in mitigating biases in a model with complex connections between its components. Overall, the model performs well, with a stable pre-industrial state and good agreement with observations in the latter period of its historical simulations. However, global mean surface temperature exhibits stronger-than-observed cooling from 1950 to 1970, followed by rapid warming from 1980 to 2014. Metrics from idealized simulations show a high climate sensitivity relative to previous generations of models: Equilibrium climate sensitivity is 5.4 K, transient climate response ranges from 2.68 to 2.85 K, and transient climate response to cumulative emissions is 2.49 to 2.66 K TtC−1.},

	abstract = {As one of the main drivers for climate change, it is important to understand changes in anthropogenic aerosol emissions and evaluate the climate impact. Anthropogenic aerosols have affected global climate while exerting a much larger influence on regional climate by their short lifetime and heterogeneous spatial distribution. In this study, the effective radiative forcing (ERF), which has been accepted as a useful index for quantifying the effect of climate forcing, was evaluated to understand the effects of aerosol on regional climate over a historical period (1850–2014). Eastern United States (EUS), Western European Union (WEU), and Eastern Central China (ECC), are regions that predominantly emit anthropogenic aerosols and were analyzed using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) simulations implemented within the framework of the Aerosol Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP) in the UK’s Earth System Model (UKESM1). In EUS and WEU, where industrialization occurred relatively earlier, the negative ERF seems to have been recovering in recent decades based on the decreasing trend of aerosol emissions. Conversely, the radiative cooling in ECC seems to be strengthened as aerosol emission continuously increases. These aerosol ERFs have been largely attributed to atmospheric rapid adjustments, driven mainly by aerosol-cloud interactions rather than direct effects of aerosol such as scattering and absorption.},

Tropospheric OH changed little from 1850 up to around 1980, then increased by around 9\&thinsp;\% up to 2014, with an associated reduction in methane lifetime. The model-derived OH trends from 1980 to 2005 are broadly consistent with trends estimated by several studies that infer OH from inversions of methyl chloroform and associated measurements; most inversion studies indicate decreases in OH since 2005. However, the model results fall within observational uncertainty ranges. The upward trend in modelled OH since 1980 was mainly driven by changes in anthropogenic near-term climate forcer emissions (increases in anthropogenic nitrogen oxides and decreases in CO). Increases in halocarbon emissions since 1950 have made a small contribution to the increase in OH, whilst increases in aerosol-related emissions have slightly reduced OH. Halocarbon emissions have dramatically reduced the stratospheric methane lifetime by about 15\&thinsp;\%–40\&thinsp;\%; most previous studies assumed a fixed stratospheric lifetime. Whilst the main driver of atmospheric methane increases since 1850 is emissions of methane itself, increased ozone precursor emissions have significantly modulated (in general reduced) methane trends. Halocarbon and aerosol emissions are found to have relatively small contributions to methane trends. These experiments do not isolate the effects of climate change on OH and methane evolution; however, we calculate residual terms that are due to the combined effects of climate change and non-linear interactions between drivers. These residual terms indicate that non-linear interactions are important and differ between the two methodologies we use for quantifying OH and methane drivers. All these factors need to be considered in order to fully explain OH and methane trends since 1850; these factors will also be important for future trends.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To improve our understanding, we use measurements from four deployments of the Atmospheric Tomography (ATom) field campaign (ATom1–4) which systematically sampled aerosol and trace gases over the Pacific and Atlantic oceans with near pole-to-pole coverage. We evaluate the UK Earth System Model (UKESM1) against ATom observations in terms of joint biases in the vertical profile of three variables related to new particle formation: total particle number concentration ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{N}$_{\textrm{Total}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}), sulfur dioxide (SO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) mixing ratio and the condensation sink. The {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{N}$_{\textrm{Total}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, SO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} and condensation sink are interdependent quantities and have a controlling influence on the vertical profile of each other; therefore, analysing them simultaneously helps to avoid getting the right answer for the wrong reasons. The simulated condensation sink in the baseline model is within a factor of 2 of observations, but the {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{N}$_{\textrm{Total}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} and SO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} show much larger biases mainly in the tropics and high latitudes. We performed a series of model sensitivity tests to identify atmospheric processes that have the strongest influence on overall model performance. The perturbations take the form of global scaling factors or improvements to the representation of atmospheric processes in the model, for example by adding a new boundary layer nucleation scheme. In the boundary layer (below 1 km altitude) and lower troposphere (1–4 km), inclusion of a boundary layer nucleation scheme (Metzger et al., 2010) is critical to obtaining better agreement with observations. However, in the mid (4–8 km) and upper troposphere ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{\&gt;}{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 8 km), sub-3 nm particle growth, pH of cloud droplets, dimethyl sulfide (DMS) emissions, upper-tropospheric nucleation rate, SO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} gas-scavenging rate and cloud erosion rate play a more dominant role. We find that perturbations to boundary layer nucleation, sub-3 nm growth, cloud droplet pH and DMS emissions reduce the boundary layer and upper tropospheric model bias simultaneously. In a combined simulation with all four perturbations, the SO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} and condensation sink profiles are in much better agreement with observations, but the {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{N}$_{\textrm{Total}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} profile still shows large deviations, which suggests a possible structural issue with how nucleation or gas/particle transport or aerosol scavenging is handled in the model. These perturbations are well-motivated in that they improve the physical basis of the model and are suitable for implementation in future versions of UKESM.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The Year 1850 to 2014 increase in methane from 808 to 1831 ppb leads to an effective radiative forcing (ERF) of 0.97 ± 0.04 W m −2 in the United Kingdom's Earth System Model, UKESM1. The direct methane contribution is 0.54 ± 0.04 W m −2. It is better represented in UKESM1 than in its predecessor model HadGEM2 due to shortwave and longwave absorption improvements and the absence of an anomalous dust response in the UKESM1 simulations. An indirect ozone ERF of 0.13–0.20 W m −2 is due to the tropospheric ozone increase outweighing that of the stratospheric decrease. The indirect water vapor ERF of 0.02–0.07 W m −2 is consistent with previous estimates. The methane increase also leads to a cloud radiative effect of 0.12 ± 0.02 W m −2 from thermodynamic adjustments and aerosol-cloud interactions (aci). Shortwave and longwave contributions of 0.23 and −0.35 W m −2 to the cloud forcing arise from radiative heating and stabilization of the upper troposphere, reducing convection and global cloud cover. The aerosol-mediated contribution (0.28–0.30 W m −2) is due to changes in oxidants reducing new particle formation (−8\%), shifting the aerosol size distribution toward fewer but larger particles. Cloud droplet number concentration decreases and cloud droplet effective radius increases.

	abstract = {The global tropospheric distributions of seven important sulfur species were simulated with a global three-dimensional chemistry-transport model (IMAGES). Surface emission and deposition velocity maps were established for use as lower boundary conditions in the model. While anthropogenic SO2 emissions are by far the largest sulfur source in the northern midlatitudes, reduced sulfur compounds, notably dimethyl sulfide (DMS) predominate over most remote areas. Simulations were performed for the present-day (∼ 1985) atmosphere. The calculated distributions are compared with available observations. The model results are found to be generally within a factor of (at most) 2–3 of long-term observations. Comparison with campaign measurements is more difficult, mostly due to the strong dependence of sulfur species concentrations on local meteorological conditions. The results, however, indicate the need for future model refinements, especially with respect to biogenic emission estimates and parameterization of cloud processes. A sensitivity study is presented to discuss the uncertainties of the results related to several parameters (the decoupling of wet scavenging and convective transport for soluble species, volcanoes emission and deposition velocities). Results are also discussed in terms of global budgets and related variables and processes. Around 125 Tg S/yr of non-sea-salt (nss) sulfur compounds (DMS, CS2, H2S, COS, and SO2) are injected into the atmosphere. The balance is mainly maintained by nss-sulfates wet and dry deposition, and by SO2 dry deposition (94\% of total sulfur deposition). It is found that DMS oxidation represents the main contribution to SO2 chemical production (80\% of the chemical sources), and that the major sink of SO2 is provided by in-cloud oxidation (90\% of the chemical sinks), under the assumption that all SO2 incorporated into clouds is oxidized. The calculated annual wet deposition of sulfates reaches 3 g S m−2 yr−1 over Europe and North America, while it is usually lower than 0.5 g S m−2 yr−1 in remote parts of the world. Estimations for the global lifetimes are 0.9 day for DMS, 4 days for CS2, 2.2 days for H2S, 0.6 day for SO2, 0.18 day for DMSO, 6.1 days for MSA, and 4.7 days for nss-sulfates.},

Polar temperatures and the lifetime of the southern polar vortex are well captured, indicating that the model is suitable for assessing the ozone hole. Ozone and long-lived tracers compare favourably to observations. Chemical-dynamical coupling, as evidenced by the anticorrelation between winter-spring northern polar ozone columns and the strength of the polar jet, is also well captured. Remaining problems relate to a warm bias at the tropical tropopause, slow ascent in the tropical pipe with implications for the lifetimes of long-lived species, and a general overestimation of ozone columns in middle and high latitudes.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a description of the tropospheric chemistry component of the UK Chemistry and Aerosols (UKCA) model which has been coupled to the Met Office Hadley Centre's HadGEM family of climate models. We assess the model's transport and scavenging processes, in particular focussing on convective transport, boundary layer mixing, wet scavenging and inter-hemispheric exchange. Simulations with UKCA of the short-lived radon tracer suggest that modelled distributions are comparable to those of other models and the comparison with observations indicate that apart from a few locations, boundary layer mixing and convective transport are effective in the model as a means of vertically redistributing surface emissions of radon. Comparisons of modelled lead tracer concentrations with observations suggest that UKCA captures surface concentrations in both hemispheres very well, although there is a tendency to underestimate the observed geographical and interannual variability in the Northern Hemisphere. In particular, UKCA replicates the shape and absolute concentrations of observed lead profiles, a key test in the evaluation of a model's wet scavenging scheme. The timescale for inter-hemispheric transport, calculated in the model using a simple krypton tracer experiment, does appear to be long relative to other models and could indicate deficiencies in tropical deep convection and/or insufficient boundary layer mixing. We also describe the main components of the tropospheric chemistry and evaluate it against observations and other tropospheric chemistry models. In particular, from a climate forcing perspective, present-day observed surface methane concentrations and tropospheric ozone concentrations are reproduced very well by the model, thereby making it suitable for long centennial integrations as well as studies of biogeochemical feedbacks. Results from both historical and future simulations with UKCA tropospheric chemistry are presented. Future projections of tropospheric ozone vary with the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP). In RCP2.6, for example, tropospheric ozone increases up to 2010 and then declines by 13\% of its year-2000 global mean by the end of the century. In RCP8.5, tropospheric ozone continues to rise steadily throughout the 21st century, with methane being the main driving factor. Finally, we highlight aspects of the UKCA model which are undergoing and/or have undergone recent developments and are suitable for inclusion in a next-generation Earth System Model.},

	abstract = {Recent estimates of global or hemispheric average forcing of climate by anthropogenic sulfate aerosol caused by scattering of shortwave radiation (“direct” effect) are uncertain by somewhat more than a factor of 2. The principal sources of this uncertainty are atmospheric chemistry properties (yield, residence time), and microphysical properties (scattering efficiency, upscatter fraction, and the dependence of these properties on particle size, composition, and relative humidity, (RH)). This paper examines the sensitivity of forcing to these microphysical properties to identify and improve understanding of the properties required to reduce the uncertainty in the forcing. The relations between aerosol loading and forcing developed here are suitable for comparing modeled and measured aerosol forcing at specific locations and for use in climate models, provided aerosol composition and microphysical properties are known, calculated, or assumed. Results are presented showing the dependence of scattering efficiency, upscatter fraction, and normalized forcing (W m−2/g(SO24−) m−2 or W g(SO24−)−1) on dry particle size (expressed as mole(sulfate) per particle), composition ((NH4)2SO4, NH4HSO4, H2SO4), solar zenith angle, latitude, and season. Forcing is strongly dependent on dry particle size and RH but is relatively insensitive to composition. The normalized forcing can be integrated over a known or assumed size distribution to evaluate the sulfate aerosol forcing. Global and annual average values of the normalized forcing are evaluated as a function of particle size and RH. Depending on values of these variables, normalized forcing may be less than, intermediate to, or greater than the range of previous estimates of sulfate aerosol forcing.},

GLOMAP-mode simulates the multi-component global aerosol, resolving sulfate, sea-salt, dust, black carbon (BC) and particulate organic matter (POM), the latter including primary and biogenic secondary POM. Aerosol processes are simulated in a size-resolved manner including primary emissions, secondary particle formation by binary homogeneous nucleation of sulfuric acid and water, particle growth by coagulation, condensation and cloud-processing and removal by dry deposition, in-cloud and below-cloud scavenging. A series of benchmark observational datasets are assembled against which the skill of the model is assessed in terms of normalised mean bias (\textit{b}) and correlation coefficient (\textit{R}). Overall, the model performs well against the datasets in simulating concentrations of aerosol precursor gases, chemically speciated particle mass, condensation nuclei (CN) and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Surface sulfate, sea-salt and dust mass concentrations are all captured well, while BC and POM are biased low (but correlate well). Surface CN concentrations compare reasonably well in free troposphere and marine sites, but are underestimated at continental and coastal sites related to underestimation of either primary particle emissions or new particle formation. The model compares well against a compilation of CCN observations covering a range of environments and against vertical profiles of size-resolved particle concentrations over Europe. The simulated global burden, lifetime and wet removal of each of the simulated aerosol components is also examined and each lies close to multi-model medians from the AEROCOM model intercomparison exercise.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Abstract. We document and evaluate the aerosol schemes as implemented in the physical and Earth system models, the Global Coupled 3.1 configuration of the Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 3 (HadGEM3-GC3.1)
and the United Kingdom Earth System Model (UKESM1), which are contributing to the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6).
The simulation of aerosols in the present-day period of the historical ensemble of these models is evaluated
against a range of observations.
Updates to the aerosol microphysics scheme are documented as well as differences in the
aerosol representation between the physical and Earth system configurations.
The additional Earth system interactions included in UKESM1 lead to differences in the emissions of
natural aerosol sources such as dimethyl sulfide, mineral dust and organic aerosol and subsequent evolution
of these species in the model.
UKESM1 also includes a stratospheric–tropospheric chemistry scheme which is fully coupled to the aerosol scheme,
while GC3.1 employs a simplified aerosol chemistry mechanism driven by prescribed monthly climatologies of
the relevant oxidants.
Overall, the simulated speciated aerosol mass concentrations compare reasonably well with observations.
Both models capture the negative trend in sulfate aerosol concentrations over Europe and the eastern United
States of America (US)
although the models tend to underestimate sulfate concentrations in both regions.
Interactive emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds in UKESM1 lead
to an improved agreement of organic aerosol over the US.
Simulated dust burdens are similar in both models despite a 2-fold difference in dust emissions.
Aerosol optical depth is biased low in dust source and outflow regions but performs well in
other regions compared to a number of satellite and ground-based retrievals of aerosol optical depth.
Simulated aerosol number concentrations are generally within a factor of 2 of the observations, with
both models tending to overestimate number concentrations over remote ocean regions, apart from
at high latitudes, and underestimate over Northern Hemisphere continents.
Finally, a new primary marine organic aerosol source is implemented in UKESM1 for the first time.
The impact of this new aerosol source is evaluated. Over the pristine Southern Ocean, it is found to improve the seasonal
cycle of organic aerosol mass and cloud droplet number concentrations relative to GC3.1
although underestimations in cloud droplet number concentrations remain.
This paper provides a useful characterisation of the aerosol climatology in both models
and will facilitate understanding in the numerous aerosol–climate interaction studies that will
be conducted as part of CMIP6 and beyond.},

	abstract = {A large number of processes are involved in the chain from emissions of aerosol precursor gases and primary particles to impacts on cloud radiative forcing. Those processes are manifest in a number of relationships that can be expressed as factors dlnX/dlnY driving aerosol effects on cloud radiative forcing. These factors include the relationships between cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration and emissions, droplet number and CCN concentration, cloud fraction and droplet number, cloud optical depth and droplet number, and cloud radiative forcing and cloud optical depth. The relationship between cloud optical depth and droplet number can be further decomposed into the sum of two terms involving the relationship of droplet effective radius and cloud liquid water path with droplet number. These relationships can be constrained using observations of recent spatial and temporal variability of these quantities. However, we are most interested in the radiative forcing since the preindustrial era. Because few relevant measurements are available from that era, relationships from recent variability have been assumed to be applicable to the preindustrial to present-day change. Our analysis of Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) model simulations suggests that estimates of relationships from recent variability are poor constraints on relationships from anthropogenic change for some terms, with even the sign of some relationships differing in many regions. Proxies connecting recent spatial/temporal variability to anthropogenic change, or sustained measurements in regions where emissions have changed, are needed to constrain estimates of anthropogenic aerosol impacts on cloud radiative forcing.},

Global model simulations have identified aerosol–cloud interactions (ACIs) as an important driver of sea surface temperature variability via surface aerosol forcing. However, ACIs are a major cause of uncertainty in climate forcing; therefore, caution is needed in interpreting the results from coarse-resolution, highly parameterized global models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Here, we separate and quantify the components of the surface shortwave effective radiative forcing (ERF) due to aerosol in the atmosphere-only version of the UK Earth System Model (UKESM1) and evaluate the cloud properties and their radiative effects against observations. We focus on a northern region of the North Atlantic (NA) where stratocumulus clouds dominate (denoted the northern NA region) and a southern region where trade cumulus and broken stratocumulus dominate (southern NA region). Aerosol forcing was diagnosed using a pair of simulations in which the meteorology is approximately fixed via nudging to analysis; one simulation has pre-industrial (PI) and one has present-day (PD) aerosol emissions. This model does not include aerosol effects within the convective parameterization (but aerosol does affect the clouds associated with detrainment) and so it should be noted that the representation of aerosol forcing for convection is incomplete.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Contributions to the surface ERF from changes in cloud fraction ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{f}$_{\textrm{c}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}), in-cloud liquid water path (LWP{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{ic}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) and droplet number concentration ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{N}$_{\textrm{d}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) were quantified. Over the northern NA region, increases in {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{N}$_{\textrm{d}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} and LWP{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{ic}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} dominate the forcing. This is likely because the already-high {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{f}$_{\textrm{c}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} there reduces the chances of further large increases in {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{f}$_{\textrm{c}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} and allows cloud brightening to act over a larger region. Over the southern NA region, increases in {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{f}$_{\textrm{c}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} dominate due to the suppression of rain by the additional aerosols. Aerosol-driven increases in macrophysical cloud properties (LWP{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{ic}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} and {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{f}$_{\textrm{c}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) will rely on the response of the boundary layer parameterization, along with input from the cloud microphysics scheme, which are highly uncertain processes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Model grid boxes with low-altitude clouds present in both the PI and PD dominate the forcing in both regions. In the northern NA, the brightening of completely overcast low cloud scenes (100 \% cloud cover, likely stratocumulus) contributes the most, whereas in the southern NA the creation of clouds with {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{f}$_{\textrm{c}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} of around 20 \% from clear skies in the PI was the largest single contributor, suggesting that trade cumulus clouds are created in response to increases in aerosol. The creation of near-overcast clouds was also important there.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}span id="page15682"/{\textgreater}The correct spatial pattern, coverage and properties of clouds are important for determining the magnitude of aerosol forcing, so we also assess the realism of the modelled PD clouds against satellite observations.

The shortwave top-of-the-atmosphere (SW{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{TOA}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) flux is overestimated by 5.8 \% in the northern NA region and 1.7 \% in the southern NA, which we attribute mainly to positive biases in low-altitude {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{f}$_{\textrm{c}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}. {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{N}$_{\textrm{d}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} is too low by {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}−{\textless}/span{\textgreater}20.6 \% in the northern NA and too high by 21.5 \% in the southern NA but does not contribute greatly to the main SW{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{TOA}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} biases.

	abstract = {Uncertainties in effective radiative forcings through aerosol–cloud interactions (ERFaci, also called aerosol indirect effects) contribute strongly to the uncertainty in the total preindustrial-to-present-day anthropogenic forcing. Some forcing estimates of the total aerosol indirect effect are so negative that they even offset the greenhouse gas forcing. This study highlights the role of oxidants in modeling of preindustrial-to-present-day aerosol indirect effects. We argue that the aerosol precursor gases should be exposed to oxidants of its era to get a more correct representation of secondary aerosol formation. Our model simulations show that the total aerosol indirect effect changes from −1.32 to −1.07 W m−2 when the precursor gases in the preindustrial simulation are exposed to preindustrial instead of presentday oxidants. This happens because of a brightening of the clouds in the preindustrial simulation, mainly due to large changes in the nitrate radical (NO3). The weaker oxidative power of the preindustrial atmosphere extends the lifetime of the precursor gases, enabling them to be transported higher up in the atmosphere and towards more remote areas where the susceptibility of the cloud albedo to aerosol changes is high. The oxidation changes also shift the importance of different chemical reactions and produce more condensate, thus increasing the size of the aerosols and making it easier for them to activate as cloud condensation nuclei.},

We improve upon existing inventories with a more consistent and reproducible methodology applied to all emission species, updated emission factors, and recent estimates through 2014. The data system relies on existing energy consumption data sets and regional and country-specific inventories to produce trends over recent decades. All emission species are consistently estimated using the same activity data over all time periods. Emissions are provided on an annual basis at the level of country and sector and gridded with monthly seasonality. These estimates are comparable to, but generally slightly higher than, existing global inventories. Emissions over the most recent years are more uncertain, particularly in low- and middle-income regions where country-specific emission inventories are less available. Future work will involve refining and updating these emission estimates, estimating emissions' uncertainty, and publication of the system as open-source software.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Climate response to atmospheric changes brought about by human activity may depend strongly on the geographical and temporal pattern of radiative forcing [Taylor and Penner, 1994]. In the case of aerosols stemming from anthropogenic sulfur emissions, geographical and temporal variations are certainly caused by variations in local mass concentration [Charlson et el., 1991; Kiehl and Briegleb, 1993], but could also arise from variations in the optical properties of sulfate aerosols. Since optical properties (including their relative humidity (RH) variation) depend fundamentally on aerosol size and chemical form and since size and chemical form are features of the aerosol which are not likely to be modeled on the global scale in the near future, geographical and temporal variations in optical properties could represent a stumbling block to accurate climate change forecasts. While extensive measurements of aerosol optical properties are needed to fully assess this problem, a preliminary assessment can be gained by considering the sensitivity of climate forcing to realistic variations in sulfate aerosol size and chemical form. Within a plausible set of assumptions (sulfate aerosol resides in the accumulation mode size range and only interacts with water vapor and ammonia vapor), we show that this sensitivity is fairly small (±20\%). This low sensitivity derives from a number of compensating factors linking the three optical parameters identified by Charlson et al. [1991]. By implication, these optical parameters, low RH scattering efficiency, the ratio of hemispheric backscatter to total scatter, and the RH dependence of scattering efficiency, should not be treated independently in either theoretical or experimental investigations of direct climate forcing. A suggested logical focus for such investigations is the backscatter efficiency at high RH. If borne out by future research, low sensitivity to sulfate aerosol size and chemistry would mean that direct sulfate climate forcing can be incorporated in global climate models with only a knowledge of sulfate mass concentration. We emphasize, therefore, the need to study the extent to which our assumptions break down, in particular, the fraction of anthropogenic sulfate that forms on coarse mode particles (i.e., those with diameters {\textgreater}1 μm) and the extent and effects of sulfate interactions with other accumulation mode components. Finally, we find that a significant fraction of direct aerosol forcing occurs in cloud-covered regions, according to a simple bulk parameterization.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic emission inventory for aerosols and reactive gases is crucial to the estimation of aerosol radiative forcing and climate effects. Here, the anthropogenic emission inventory for AerChemMIP, endorsed by CMIP6, is briefly introduced. The CMIP6 inventory is compared with a country-level inventory (i.e., MEIC) over China from 1986 to 2015. Discrepancies are found in the yearly trends of the two inventories, especially after 2006. The yearly trends of the aerosol burdens simulated by CESM2 using the two inventories follow their emission trends and deviate after the mid-2000s, while the simulated aerosol optical depths (AODs) show similar trends. The difference between the simulated AODs is much smaller than the difference between model and observation. Although the simulated AODs agree with the MODIS satellite retrievals for country-wide average, the good agreement is an offset between the underestimation in eastern China and the overestimation in western China. Low-biased precursor gas of SO2, overly strong convergence of the wind field, overly strong dilution and transport by summer monsoon circulation, too much wet scavenging by precipitation, and overly weak aerosol swelling due to low-biased relative humidity are suggested to be responsible for the underestimated AOD in eastern China. This indicates that the influence of the emission inventory uncertainties on simulated aerosol properties can be overwhelmed by model biases of meteorology and aerosol processes. It is necessary for climate models to perform reasonably well in the dynamical, physical, and chemical processes that would influence aerosol simulations.},

The method also yields an aerosol radiative forcing decomposition that includes a term quantifying the impact of changes in surface albedo.

	abstract = {Abstract. By coordinating the design and distribution of global climate model simulations of the past, current, and future climate, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) has become one of the foundational elements of climate science. However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations (1850–near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP historical simulations, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions:  – How does the Earth system respond to forcing? – What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases?  – How can we assess future climate changes given internal climate variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios? This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.},
