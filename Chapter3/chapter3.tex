\section*{Abstract}

The sulfate aerosol formation simulation was developed in the 1970s as a one-dimensional model. As the atmosphere model became more sophisticated and coupled with other Earth system components, questions on the interaction of aerosol with other components have arisen.

Aerosol-cloud interactions are a source of uncertainty in climate predictions. Earth systems models (ESM) increasingly feature online, i.e. fully-coupled, treatments of the interactions between chemistry, aerosols, and clouds.  

Here, we present an analysis of experiments performed with an ESM featuring a detailed two-moment, modal aerosol scheme and detailed atmospheric chemistry scheme, which aim to quantify the role of emissions changes and atmospheric oxidation on radiative forcing.

We use the histSST-piX simulations performed using UKESM1.0 as part of the  Aerosol Chemistry Model Intercomparison (AerChemMIP) project from the Coupled-Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) experiments. These experiments are designed to understand the role of changes in emissions of short-term climate forcers on the radiative balance of the atmosphere through transient, atmosphere-only experiments across the period 1850-2014, 

Here we present an analysis of the impact of changes in aerosol precursors, e.g.\ce{SO2}, ozone precursors (e.g. \ce{NO_x} and \ce{CO}, and methane on aerosol formation, and radiative forcing. We quantify the effect of changes in atmospheric oxidant levels, e.g. \ce{O3} and \ce{OH}, on aerosol formation, and the impact on cloud properties and radiative forcing.

We find strong sensitivity to the levels of tropospheric OH, mediated by methane and ozone precursors, and impacts on aerosol nucleation rate, and aerosol size distribution. The effect of historical increases in methane, for example, leads to suppressed OH (28\% lower) and lower nucleation rate, larger aerosols and lower cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC). As a result,\ce{CH4} contributes to a positive cloud radiative effect of 0.21$\pm$0.15 W m$^{-2}$ between 2000-2014, further adding to the warming impact of methane on the climate.

The effect of historical ozone precursor emissions changes is to enhance OH, with increased aerosol optical depth (10\%). Ultimately, ozone precursors increase the aerosol instantaneous radiative forcing by up to 0.08$\pm$0.05 W m$^{-2}$ between 2000-2014, which is 44\% of aerosol direct effect due to aerosol precursors, further cooling the climate.

Increase in \ce{CH4} concentration and \ce{O3} precursors nearly completely offset each other in terms of OH, but the response of aerosols, clouds and forcing is more complex, with competing effects that only partially counteract each other--highlighting the importance of changes in oxidants in the atmosphere.


\section{Introduction}

In this chapter, the effects of oxidant changes on sulfate aerosol formation, aerosol and cloud properties and aerosol effective radiative forcing are investigated using a set of simulations performed by UKESM1. AerChemMIP proposed a series of single forcing experiments where one component of the oxidant-aerosol-climate nexus was held constant at 1850 levels and all other drivers of the system were allowed to vary in a transient simulation from 1850-2014 \citep{collinsAerChemMIPQuantifyingEffects2017}. The AerChemMIP transient historical prescribed sea-surface temperature experiments (\textit{histSST}s) runs allow for quantification of the oxidants' effects on the evolution of aerosol ERF, a subject that has so far received little attention in the literature. 

The AerChemMIP experimental design complements the Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) historical simulations by allowing the role of individual drivers of the changes in the coupled aerosol-oxidant-climate system to respond. By fixing \ce{CH4} to 1850 levels (\sstpich{}) the experiment allows for an increase in OH over time as increases in \ce{CH4} have led to a depletion in OH \citep{zhaoRoleTrendVariability2020}. Similarly, fixing \ce{SO2} and other aerosol emissions (black carbons and organic carbons) to 1850 levels (\sstpiaer{}) enables us to quantify the response of the system to the changes in aerosols. The use of transient experiments enables us to examine the response of the system to the spatio-temporal evolution of anthropogenic emission sources, which have driven the changes since the pre-industrial era. 


We investigate the time evolution of these processes due to changes in oxidants. In particular, we investigate the shift in aerosol size distribution over time due to oxidants which have a knock-on effect on aerosol effective radiative forcing. We examine the aerosol and cloud properties, and ultimately, aerosol ERF. 


This chapter is outlined as follows. The information about the simulation is presented in Section \ref{sec:ch3:aerchemmip}. The oxidant chemistry in the model is described, followed by the aerosol module description. Results and discussions are presented and discussed in Section \ref{sec:ch3:results}.

\section{Methods and data}
\label{sec:ch3:methods}

As described in Chapter \ref{ch2:title}, this work uses the UK's Earth System Model1, UKESM1 \citep{sellarUKESM1DescriptionEvaluation2019}, data provided for the AerChemMIP \citep{collinsAerChemMIPQuantifyingEffects2017} to examine the effects of \ce{SO2} oxidation on radiative balance. 

Specifically, this chapter examines the global properties of \ce{SO2} oxidation, aerosol formation, cloud properties, and radiative effects. General model description and validation are detailed in Chapter \ref{ch2:title}. Concepts, simulations, and calculations unique to this chapter are described below. 

\subsection{The Aerosol Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project}
\label{sec:ch3:aerchemmip}


The simulations used in this work were designed by the Aerosol Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project \citep[AerChemMIP;][]{collinsAerChemMIPQuantifyingEffects2017}. As part of the project, transient historical prescribed sea-surface temperature experiments (\textit{histSST}s) were proposed to investigate transient ERFs. These simulations use atmosphere-only configurations with prescribed monthly mean sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea ice taken from one ensemble member of the \hist{} simulation from the CMIP6 Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima (DECK) experiments \citep{eyringOverviewCoupledModel2016}. 


The experiment is set up as follows. The control simulation, \textit{histSST}, uses prescribed historical SSTs with all emissions set as is historical. The perturbed simulations have some of the emissions or concentrations set to the pre-industrial, i.e. 1850, level as shown in Table \ref{tab:ch3:histSST-exp} to determine its effect on the atmosphere. For example, \textit{histSST-piAer} has its aerosol precursor emissions set to pre-industrial levels. In this thesis, we refer to \textit{histSST-piAer} as \sstpiaer{}, \textit{histSST-piO3} as \sstpio{}, and so on, for brevity.

\subsection{Short-lived climate forcer precursor emissions}
\label{sec:ch3:emissions}

AerChemMIP used historical forcing datasets and boundary conditions from the Community Emissions Data System \citep[CEDS;][]{hoeslyHistorical175020142018}. This dataset included historical emissions of short-lived climate forcer precursors: aerosol precursors, \ce{O3} precursors, and \ce{CH4}. 

Short-lived climate forcers are either emitted directly into the atmosphere or have their concentration prescribed at the surface, as in the case of \ce{CH4} or produced through reactions from their precursors, as in the case of sulfate aerosols and \ce{O3}. Figure \ref{fig:ch3:emissions} shows the diagnosed emissions for \ce{SO2}, \ce{O3} precursor emissions, including carbon monoxide (\ce{CO}), biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), nitric oxide (\ce{NO}) as \ce{NO_x}, and methane (\ce{CH4}) concentration. The plots also show the 1850 counter-factual emissions used in perturbed runs (\textit{piX}).

Emissions of ozone precursors include (c) carbon monoxide, (d) prescribed \ce{NO_x} from surface and aircraft, (e) lightning \ce{NO_x}, and (f) biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). Lightning  \ce{NO_x} and BVOC are interactively simulated and are shown for each simulation.}
    \label{fig:ch3:emissions}
\end{figure}

In UKESM1, \ce{O3} precursors include surface \ce{NO_x}, lightning \ce{NO_x}, \ce{CO} and biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emissions and are calculated from the following CMIP6 variables: \textit{eminox}, \textit{emilnox}, \textit{emico}, and \textit{emibvoc}, respectively. The \textit{eminox} variable is the sum of anthropogenic, biomass burning, soil and aircraft \ce{NO_x}. Biomass burning contributes 6.4 Tg(N) yr$^{-1}$ and soil contributes 5.6 Tg(N) yr$^{-1}$ \citep{archibaldDescriptionEvaluationUKCA2020}. Anthropogenic \ce{NO_x} increases from 0 to 40.2 Tg(N) yr$^{-1}$ between 1850 and 2015. Lighting \ce{NO_x} is simulated interactively in UKESM1 with convective clouds. Historical changes in \ce{NO_x} emissions are driven by changes in anthropogenic \ce{NO_x} at the surface.

\ce{CH4} concentration shown in Figure \ref{fig:ch3:emissions} is taken from variable \textit{ch4}. The UKESM1 constrains lower boundary conditions to simulate atmospheric \ce{CH4} concentration. Since \ce{CH4} has a lifetime of 8.1-9.8 years \citep{oconnorAssessmentPreindustrialPresentday2021}, it is well-mixed across the atmosphere from the surface constraint. Figure \ref{fig:ch3:emissions} shows that global \ce{CH4} concentration has increased monotonically since the 1850s from 800 ppb up to 1750 ppb in 2014. 

Aerosol precursors include \ce{SO2}, organic carbons (OCs) and black carbons (BCs). In the UKESM1, sources of BCs are exclusively primary emissions, while sources of OCs are a combination of primary and chemical production of secondary organic aerosol \citep{mulcahyDescriptionEvaluationAerosol2020}. Sulfate aerosols are produced through oxidation. Anthropogenic \ce{SO2} are emitted at the surface, and 2.5\% of the total emission is assumed to be emitted as primary sulfate particles with an aerosol size distribution specified in \citep{stierAerosolclimateModelECHAM5HAM2005}. 

Total \ce{SO2} emissions are calculated from the \textit{emiso2} variable. This includes both primary volcanic and anthropogenic \ce{SO2} emissions but does not include secondary production from DMS oxidation. While anthropogenic \ce{SO2} emissions play a significant role in the overall \ce{SO2} budget, natural emissions are not negligible. However, the AerChemMIP simulations employed in this thesis did not archive the secondary natural \ce{SO2} production from DMS oxidation. Fortunately, secondary production is reported in The UKESM1 18-year AMIP simulation \citep{mulcahyDescriptionEvaluationAerosol2020}. The Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) is an atmosphere-only configuration for detailed aerosol budget analysis driven by observed sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice. It reported the emission rate for anthropogenic, primary and secondary natural \ce{SO2} emissions as 60.6, 14.06 and 16.69 Tg(S) yr$^{-1}$, respectively \citep{mulcahyDescriptionEvaluationAerosol2020}. 

\subsection{Research opportunities and motivation}

Compared to its predecessor, HadGEM2-ES, UKESM1 features many enhancement capabilities that allow investigating oxidant perturbations on radiation\citep{sellarUKESM1DescriptionEvaluation2019}. The most notable enhancement is the prognostic aerosol size distribution used by radiation and cloud microphysics, which improves the representation of aerosol radiative forcing. The coupling is both ways, allowing photolytic reaction rates to react to radiative intensity. Oxidation processes for sulfate aerosol are coupled to online chemistry. GLOMAP-mode simulates sulfate aerosol using chemical production from gas and aqueous phases. It also simulates aerosol number and mass concentration independently with inter-modal interactions such as coagulation, condensation, and wet and dry deposition. 

this also us to dig deep into the feedback to aerosol production from changes in other SLCF .


\section{Results and discussions}
\label{sec:ch3:results}



\subsection{Oxidant changes due to near-term climate forcers}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Chapter3/Figs/f02_oxidant-changes.eps}
    \caption[Global annual mean tropospheric oxidant concentrations or mixing ratios]{Global annual mean tropospheric oxidant concentrations or mixing ratios for species related to \ce{SO2} oxidation in each experiment as mentioned in Table \ref{tab:ch3:histSST-exp}}
    \label{fig:ch3:oxidants}
\end{figure}

Available oxidants play an important role in controlling the oxidation rate. Figure \ref{fig:ch3:oxidants} shows global annual mean of tropospheric oxidants that influence \ce{SO2} oxidation, including \ce{OH}, \ce{O3}, \ce{H2O2} and \ce{SO2}. It shows that the \ce{SO2} mixing ratio follows the \ce{SO2} emission trends (Figure \ref{fig:ch3:emissions}), reaching its peak in 1975 with the maximum mixing ratio reaching 0.14 ppb. \ce{O3} precursor emissions decrease the \ce{SO2} mixing ratio by 27.5\% (from 0.13 to 0.10 ppb) as the decrease in oxidants in the counterfactual, \sstpio{}, decreases the chemical sink of \ce{SO2}. 


Historical \ce{O3} mixing ratio is controlled by \ce{O3} precursor emissions and also \ce{CH4}. Comparing \histsst{} with \sstpio{} in Figure \ref{fig:ch3:oxidants}c, the \ce{O3} mixing ratios show an increase in the historical period with the main source of \ce{O3} coming from \ce{O3} precursors including \ce{NO_x}, \ce{CO} and BVOCs, all of which shows a monotonic increase since 1850 \citep{griffithsTroposphericOzoneCMIP62021}. \ce{CH4} is another source of \ce{O3} as \ce{CH4} forms methyl dioxide (\ce{CH_3O_2}) which reacts with \ce{NO} to form formaldehyde (\ce{HCHO}). \ce{HCHO} photolysis yields \ce{CO} which is a source of tropospheric \ce{O3}. Keeping \ce{CH4} at 1850 level decreases tropospheric \ce{O3} as shown in the Figure \ref{fig:ch3:oxidants}c in \sstpich{}.


Historical \ce{OH} concentrations remain constant until 1975 and increase by \qty{0.1e6}{\per\centi\metre\cubed} by the end of 2014 in the historical trajectory (histSST). The lack of increase in \ce{O3} precursor emissions lowers OH concentration by 15\% (from \num{1.25e6} to \qty{1.05e6}{\per\centi\metre\cubed}) as shown in \sstpio{} and \sstpintcf{} compared to the historical trajectory, \histsst{}. This decrease is due to less OH production by the reaction of water vapour with excited oxygen atoms \ce{(O(^1D))}, which are produced by \ce{O3} photolysis ($\lambda$ < 340 nm). In contrast, for \sstpich{}, where \ce{CH4} concentration is held at the 1850 level, \ce{OH} concentrations increase above the historical trajectory. In this case, OH production rates are lower due to lower \ce{O3} in this simulation. The absence of an increase in \ce{CH4} levels reduces the OH sink via \ce{OH + CH4}. Overall, the effect of historical increases in \ce{CH4} is seen as an increase in OH. The effect of historical increases in \ce{CH4} on OH can be seen since 1875, with the \ce{OH} concentration in 2014 increasing to 133\% that of 1850. 


\ce{H2O2} mixing ratio in the historical period increases after 1850, which could be attributed to NTCF emissions and sea surface temperature (SST). \ce{HO2} produces \ce{H2O2}. Keeping \ce{CH4} at 1850 levels decreases \ce{H2O2} levels as \ce{CH4} is a source of \ce{HO2} radicals, via reactions that form \ce{HCHO} and \ce{HO2} radicals (and hence \ce{H2O2}). \ce{H2O2} is also contributed by \ce{CO}, an \ce{O3} precursor, via its reaction with \ce{OH} to form \ce{HO2}. 


The historical changes of all oxidants are subject to the uncertainty of their sources and chemical processes included in the model. \citet{fanComparisonAnthropogenicEmission2022} reported that \ce{SO2} emissions over China in CMIP6 deviated from the bottom-up, country-level inventory after 2005. This would affect the accuracy of the \ce{SO2} mixing ratio and, consequently, the oxidation downstream. The recent rise in \ce{OH} concentration was also observed in other climate models \citep{zhaoIntermodelComparisonGlobal2019}. 


To summarise this section, historical \ce{O3} precursor emissions promote \ce{OH} concentration, \ce{O3} and \ce{H2O2} mixing ratio. The historical \ce{CH4} reacts away \ce{OH} but boosts \ce{O3} and \ce{H2O2}. The \ce{SO2} emissions from aerosol precursors increase the \ce{SO2} mixing ratio as its main anthropogenic source.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\ce{SO2}}{SO2} oxidation and budget changes due to SLCFs}

\subsubsection{\textsoo{} oxidation}
\label{sec:ch3:oxidation}


In the UKESM1, \ce{SO2} reacts with \ce{OH} in the gas phase, forming sulfuric acids which nucleate into sulfate aerosols. \ce{SO2} also reacts and with \ce{H2O2} and \ce{O3} in the aqueous phase to form sulfate aerosols. Figure \ref{fig:ch3:oxidation} shows total annual tropospheric \ce{SO2} oxidation tendencies in each pathway. In the historical period, \ce{SO2} oxidation by \ce{OH} is the largest of the three pathways, contributing 20 Tg(S) yr$^{-1}$ globally in 2014. The \ce{SO2 + OH} trend broadly follows the \ce{SO2} emissions and the \ce{OH} concentration trends. The lower \ce{OH} concentration decreases \ce{SO2 + OH} reaction tendencies in \sstpio{}, and, similarly, the increase in OH concentration in \textit{piCH4} enhances \ce{SO2 + OH} reaction tendencies.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Chapter3/Figs/f03_oxidation.eps}
    \caption[Global annual \ce{SO2} oxidation tendencies]{Global annual \ce{SO2} oxidation tendencies between 1850-2014 with changes due to constraining  methane concentration (\textit{piCH4}), aerosol precursors (\sstpiaer{}), ozone precursors (\sstpio{}) or both emissions (\textit{piNTCF}) at 1850 level.}
    \label{fig:ch3:oxidation}
\end{figure}


\ce{SO2 + O3} reaction tendencies, however, are not sensitive to changes in \ce{O3} mixing ratios. Figure \ref{fig:ch3:oxidants}b shows that the global \ce{O3} mixing ratio monotonically increases after 1850, but historical \ce{SO2 + O3} does not share the trend. As a result of anthropogenic \ce{O3} precursor emissions being fixed at the 1850 level in \sstpio{}, the \ce{O3} concentration is lower than that of \textit{histSST}. Despite the 25\% decrease in \ce{O3} mixing ratio in \sstpio{} and \textit{piCH4}, there are minimal changes to \ce{SO2 - O3} tendencies in these experiments compared to \textit{histSST}. The lack of change implies that globally \ce{SO2 + O3} oxidation is not sensitive to historical changes in \ce{O3} and that the background tropospheric \ce{O3} is sufficient to saturate the pathway. 

\ce{SO2 + H2O2} oxidation tendencies follow the \ce{SO2} emissions and \ce{H2O2} mixing ratio trends. The historical oxidation tendency starts at 7.5 Tg(S) yr$^{-1}$ and increases to 16 Tg(S) yr$^{-1}$ and stabilises after the 1980s. The \ce{SO2 + H2O2} reaction tendencies decrease by 15\% when the \ce{H2O2} mixing ratio decreases in the absence of anthropogenic \ce{CH4} which is a source of \ce{H2O2} precursor. 


While past measurements and laboratory research have determined that only \ce{OH} is important for the oxidation of \ce{SO2} in the gas phase during daytime \citep[][and reference therein]{rattiganUptakeGasphaseSO22000, eatoughConversionSO2Sulfate1994}, heterogeneous and aqueous-phase oxidation is more complex with multiple competing oxidants and aerosol properties at play \citep{pattantyusReviewSulfurDioxide2018, seinfeldAtmosphericChemistryPhysics2016}. 

Other \ce{SO2} oxidation pathways may be important in certain environments such as clean marine boundary layers and wintertime. The oxidation of S(IV) in the atmosphere includes organic peroxides, and iron and manganese as catalysts to oxygen \citet{alexanderTransitionMetalcatalyzedOxidation2009, seinfeldAtmosphericChemistryPhysics2016}. A further mechanism for \ce{SO2} oxidation in solution with sea water is proposed via halogen compounds \ce{HOCl} and \ce{HOBr} in the remote marine boundary layer \citep{vogtMechanismHalogenRelease1996}. Aside from oxidation with \ce{OH}, \ce{O3} and \ce{H2O2}, these further mechanisms are not included in the UKESM1 so they are not considered in this study.

Overall, the rate of \ce{SO2} oxidation with \ce{OH}, \ce{O3} and \ce{H2O2} is controlled by \ce{SO2} abundance, as the reaction tendency tends to be constant over time without aerosol precursor emissions (green line in Figure \ref{fig:ch3:oxidation}). The \ce{OH} and \ce{H2O2} pathways contribute equally to \ce{SO2} oxidation in the 1850s but the rate of growth of \ce{SO2 + OH} oxidation is greater post-1950s, making \ce{SO2 + OH} the most important oxidising pathway. \ce{O3} is the least important oxidant globally, contributing to the removal of at most 8 Tg(S) yr$^{-1}$. Overall, the \ce{SO2 + OH} pathway is the most sensitive to oxidant changes in which the spread between \sstpio{} and \textit{piCH4} is approximately 5 Tg(S) yr$^{-1}$ or 25\% of the \textit{histSST} oxidation rate in 2014.



\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\ce{SO2}}{SO2} and \texorpdfstring{\ce{SO4}}{SO4} burdens, losses, lifetimes, and budgets}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Chapter3/Figs/f04_s-budget.eps}
    \caption[Tropospheric sulfur budget: burdens, depositions and lifetimes]{Tropospheric \ce{SO2} and \ce{SO4} budget, including (a-b) burdens, (c-d) dry depositions, (e-f) wet depositions, and (g-h) lifetimes. The plots show budget terms between 1850-2014 with changes due to constraining  methane concentration (\textit{piCH4}), aerosol precursors (\sstpiaer{}), ozone precursors (\sstpio{}) or both emissions (\textit{piNTCF}) at the 1850 level.}
    \label{fig:ch3:s-burden}
\end{figure}

\ce{SO2} reacts with \ce{OH}, \ce{H2O2} and \ce{O3} to form sulfate (\ce{SO4}) so the budget of \ce{SO2} and \ce{SO4} are linked via these oxidation processes. Figure \ref{fig:ch3:s-burden} shows that the \ce{SO2} burden trend follows that of \ce{SO2} emissions. \ce{SO2} is lost mainly through oxidation (45 Tg(S) yr$^{-1}$ in 2014) followed by dry deposition (28 Tg(S) yr$^{-1}$). The lifetime of \ce{SO2} is 3 days in the 1850s and decreases to 2.8 days in 2014. 

Oxidants affect the \ce{SO2} budget in various ways. The lifetime of a trace gas describes how long it stays in the atmosphere and is defined as the average time that a molecule of that species remains in a reservoir before removal. Suppose the reservoir is the whole atmosphere and is in a steady state. In that case, the burden is considered constant, and the tropospheric lifetime of a compound is estimated by dividing the total tropospheric burden by total loss. \ce{SO2} loss terms include chemical losses via oxidation with \ce{OH}, \ce{O3}, and \ce{H2O2}, wet and dry deposition. \ce{SO4} is lost only via wet and dry deposition.

The lower levels of \ce{O3} in \sstpio{} result in less \ce{OH}, which leads to a smaller \ce{SO2} sink than in \textit{histSST}. This increases the \ce{SO2} burden, dry and wet deposition and ultimately leads to a longer lifetime. This change to the \ce{SO2} budget due to lower \ce{O3} is also seen in \sstpiaer{} and \textit{piNTCF} where \ce{SO2} is kept at the 1850 level throughout the historical period. In \textit{piNTCF}, in which \ce{O3} precursor emissions are kept at the 1850 level (low \ce{O3}), the \ce{SO2} burden, wet and dry deposition and lifetime are lower compared to the case that \ce{O3} precursors follow the historical trajectory (\sstpiaer{}). This further indicates the role of \ce{O3} in the \ce{SO2} budget via oxidation with \ce{OH}.


In contrast to \sstpio{}, where the lower \ce{O3} and oxidant levels increase \ce{SO2}, the \ce{SO2} burden stays roughly the same when \ce{CH4} concentration is kept at 1850 level in \textit{piCH4}, despite the huge differences in \ce{CH4} and as a result OH (see Figure \ref{fig:ch3:emissions}). This is because whilst there is a significant increase in \ce{SO2 + OH} oxidation in \textit{piCH4}, this is nullified by the decrease in \ce{SO2 + H2O2} oxidation as seen in figure \ref{fig:ch3:oxidation}a and c. In this case, the \ce{SO2} lifetime remains unchanged compared with the \textit{histSST}.

Figure \ref{fig:ch3:s-burden} shows that, in \sstpio{}, exposing \ce{SO2} emissions to pre-industrial \ce{O3} increases the lifetime of both \ce{SO2} and \ce{SO4}. The effect of oxidant changes to \ce{SO2} lifetime was observed in a modelled study by \citep{karsetStrongImpactsAerosol2018}. They found that by replacing oxidants (\ce{NO3}, \ce{O3}, \ce{OH} and \ce{HO2}) from present-day to pre-industrial, the lifetime of pre-industrial \ce{SO2} increases from 29 hours (1.21 days) to 34 hours (1.42 days), which is an increase by 17\%. In this work, the \ce{SO2} lifetime increases by 28\% (from 2.17 days to 2.77 days). As aerosols have a longer lifetime, they are transported higher up in the atmosphere before oxidising, making them less likely to be removed by deposition. The dry deposition of the newly formed nucleation mode \ce{SO4} decreased by 2.6\%. 

The \ce{SO4} burden is generally higher than that of \ce{SO2} because of its longer lifetime. The \ce{SO4} burden has increased from 0.3 to 0.7 Tg(S) yr$^{-1}$ between 1850 and 2014. Because UKESM1 treats \ce{SO4} as an aqueous aerosol, the primary removal process for \ce{SO4} is wet deposition. The lifetime of \ce{SO4} is 5.5-6 days, double that of \ce{SO2}. Changes in oxidants have a knock-on effect on \ce{SO4} budget and lifetime. In \sstpio{} where anthropogenic \ce{O3} is missing, there is less \ce{SO4} wet deposition as there is less conversion from \ce{SO2} to \ce{SO4} and more physical removal of \ce{SO2} (via both wet and dry deposition). This reduction in \ce{O3} and oxidants in \sstpio{} also results in an increase in \ce{SO4} lifetime compared to \textit{histSST}. 


The budget report in our work is comparable to that reported by the UKESM1 evaluation using AMIP simulation covering 1981-1998 \citep{mulcahyDescriptionEvaluationAerosol2020}. The AMIP \ce{SO2} and \ce{SO4} are 0.53 and 0.67 Tg(S), respectively, the same as our values. For dry deposition, the AMIP values for \ce{SO2} and \ce{SO4} are 28.98 and 7.10 Tg(S) yr$^{-1}$, comparable to that of ours of 28.90 and 7.13 Tg(S) yr$^{-1}$. As for the wet deposition, the AMIP reported 13.38 and 36.0 Tg(S) yr$^{-1}$ for \ce{SO2} and \ce{SO4}, while our results are 13.47 and 36.40 Tg(S) yr$^{-1}$. Finally, the AMIP lifetime of \ce{SO2} and \ce{SO4} are 2.08 and 5.56 days, respectively, which are comparable to our work (2.23 and 5.56 days).  

The SLCFs simulated by UKESM1 have been evaluated against both ground-based measurements and field campaigns \citep[e.g.][]{griffithsTroposphericOzoneCMIP62021, russoSeasonalInterannualDecadal2023}. The UKESM1 CMIP6 simulations capture the \ce{SO4} trends compared to ground-based measurements \citep{mulcahyDescriptionEvaluationAerosol2020}. The observed decreasing trend in \ce{SO4} concentration across Europe is reproduced by the model. Although there is a consistent underprediction of the absolute values for all years, the model prediction sits within the observed variability. The UKESM1 overestimated \ce{SO2} concentration compared to the Atmospheric Tomography (ATom) field campaign which measures atmospheric constituents and chemical processes in marine remote areas across both hemispheres \citep{ranjithkumarConstraintsGlobalAerosol2021}. The UKESM1 model overestimated \ce{SO2} concentration by approximately a factor 2–6 in the boundary layer regions of the tropics and mid-latitudes and the tropical upper troposphere. The biases in the upper-tropospheric mid and high latitudes are negligible. This may imply that the \ce{SO2} removal process is underestimated or that the natural secondary emissions from DMS are overestimated.  

An in-depth evaluation has shown that the UKESM1 underestimated the dry deposition process and there has been an update released for the model to amend for this error \citep{hardacreEvaluationSO2SO422021}. Model evaluation against ground-based measurements shows that while the UKESM1 captures historical trends for decreasing the concentration of \ce{SO2} and \ce{SO4}, it overpredicts \ce{SO2} by a factor of 3 and underpredicted surface \ce{SO4} by 25-35\% \citep{hardacreEvaluationSO2SO422021}. This has led to an update to the UKESM1 configuration called the UKESM1.1 \citep{mulcahyUKESM11DevelopmentEvaluation2023}. When a more realistic dry deposition scheme is implemented, it reduces the model’s overprediction of surface \ce{SO2} concentrations and total column \ce{SO2} but also decreases the overall \ce{SO4} loading, exacerbating the low bias.  Our study used the original UKESM1 thus the overestimation of \ce{SO2} is expected.


\subsection{Aerosol properties changes due to SLCFs}

\subsubsection{Aerosol optical depth}

    \caption[Global annual mean aerosol AOD between 1850-2014 with changes due to SLCFs]{Global annual mean aerosol AOD between 1850-2014 with changes due to constraining methane concentration (\textit{piCH4}), aerosol precursors (\sstpiaer{}), ozone precursors (\sstpio{}) or both emissions (\textit{piNTCF}) at 1850 level.}
    \label{fig:ch3:AOD}
\end{figure}


The amount of aerosol in the atmosphere is linked to \ce{SO2} oxidation tendency as it produces \ce{SO4} aerosols. Figure \ref{fig:ch3:AOD} shows annual global mean AOD from different experiments. It shows that aerosol precursors increase AOD by 50\% and are the main contributor to global AOD. AOD in the piO3 experiment is lower than histSST by 0.05, suggesting that ozone contributes to some aerosol formation. Global AOD is unchanged under lower \ce{CH4} condition in piCH4.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Chapter3/Figs/f06_aod-map.png}
    \caption[Mean aerosol AOD at 550 nm from 1980-1989 and changes to AOD due to SLCFs]{(a) Decadal mean aerosol AOD at 550 nm from 1980-1989. (b-d) Difference of aerosol AOD at 550 nm from 1980-1989 between \textit{histSST} and \sstpiaer{}, \sstpio{}, and \textit{piCH4}, respectively. Hatched areas denote areas in which the difference is not statically significant (p$\leq$0.05)}
    \label{fig:ch3:AOD-map}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:ch3:AOD-map} shows the location of AOD changes due to oxidants. There is a localised increase of AOD in the high emission areas such as Northern America, Central Europe, and Eastern Asia due to aerosol precursor emissions in the 1980s, when the main aerosol precursor is \ce{SO2}. \ce{O3} precursors are responsible for 20\% of AOD in these areas (0.08 out of 0.4 over the European region, for example). \ce{CH4} has an insignificant effect on AOD. This is due to the nullifying nature of the change: increase of \ce{SO2 + OH} oxidation and the decrease in \ce{SO2 + H2O2} which results in approximately net zero change in total oxidation tendency compared to \textit{histSST}. This shows that although a global change of reaction tendency was observed, it may not be reflected in some aerosol diagnostics such as AOD. We note here that anthropogenic \ce{CH4} is shown, in the next section, to affect cloud properties.

% Compare the AOD evaluation in Mulcahy and also discuss the updated AOD from Hardarcre and UKESM1.1
AOD simulated by the UKESM1 against both ground-based measurements and satellite retrievals and found good agreement in trends but underestimated the absolute values \citep{mulcahyDescriptionEvaluationAerosol2020}. The global annual mean AOD trends from AMIP simulation between 1980-2015 show an overall increase in AOD which is consistent with the Collection 6 MODIS merged dataset (MODIS C6) satellite retrieval. The absolute AOD is underestimated by 0.03 but is still within the lower end of the range of the satellite AOD. The spatial distribution shows that the UIKESM1 has higher AOD in the winter seasons of each hemisphere. This is due to the high sea-salt emission which peaks in the winter months. The high bias in sea-salt AOD does not affect our analysis which subtracts AOD from \sstpiaer{}, \sstpio{} and \textit{piCH4} with \textit{histSST}.

% discuss the updated effect of dry deposition from UKESM1 with UKESM1.1
The UKESM1 was updated with a new dry deposition scheme and a revised dust tuning which affects the predicted aerosol AOD \citep{mulcahyUKESM11DevelopmentEvaluation2023}. The new version of UKESM1, the UKESM1.1, predicted a lower aerosol AOD, with a difference of at least 0.02 starting from 1980 due to a higher \ce{SO2} dry deposition which removes \ce{SO2} from the atmosphere, leaving less to oxidise to form \ce{SO4}. This new dry deposition scheme further increases the low bias in \ce{SO4} concentration compared to measurements. The annual mean AOD from UKESM1 and UKESM1.1 over 2003-2014 shows that the global mean AOD predicted by the models are 0.137 and 0.146, respectively, which are lower than most satellite measurements from MODIS (0.162), ORAC (0.170) and Swansea (0.135). These products, their uncertainties and details of the evaluation procedure are described in detail in \citet{mulcahyDescriptionEvaluationAerosol2020}. The spatial increase in the AOD in UKESM1.1 stems from the revised dust tuning which increases the dust AOD over and downwind of major dust source regions. This update is not relevant to \ce{SO2} oxidation. However, there is a decrease in AOD in UKESM1.1 over China due to an increase in \ce{SO2} dry deposition. Our work used output from the original UKESM1 thus the AOD will have a less low bias in absolute AOD and higher overall \ce{SO4} loading.



\subsubsection{Aerosol size distribution}
\label{sec:ch3:result:aerosol-size-dist}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Chapter3/Figs/f08_aerosol-size-dist-over-time.png}
    \caption[Aerosol size distribution for 2010-2014 at 1 km]{(top) Historical total aerosol size distribution at 1 km for 2010-2014 with percentage difference on the secondary axis. (bottom) The progression of percentage change of aerosol size distribution due to (d) aerosol precursors, (e) \ce{O3} precursors, and (f) \ce{CH4}. The vertical dashed line denotes the 50 nm diameter (25 nm radius) above which aerosol affects cloud nucleation.}
    \label{fig:ch3:aerosol-size-dist-time}
\end{figure}


Perturbation to oxidants modifies global aerosol size distribution over the historical period. The top panels of figure \ref{fig:ch3:aerosol-size-dist-time} show aerosol size distribution and percentage differences between \textit{histSST} and the \sstpiaer{}, \sstpio{} and \textit{piCH4} simulations for 2010-2014 at 1 km. The bottom panels show the progression of change in aerosol size over time. In panels (d - f), each horizontal bar denotes the percentage difference of global decadal mean aerosol size distribution at 1 km between \textit{histSST} and the perturbed simulations. For example, the percentage differences for 2010-2014 in figures (a-c) are plotted as the topmost colour bar in figures (d-f). 

As shown by figure \ref{fig:ch3:aerosol-size-dist-time}d, historical aerosol precursor emissions increase aerosol concentrations with diameters smaller than 50 nm by more than 40\%  between the 1960s and 1980s. The number of particles greater than 50 nm in diameter (N50 -- dashed grey vertical line) has increased by 30-35\% and this is likely to affect the concentration of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) \citep{seinfeldAtmosphericChemistryPhysics2016}. In contrast, historical \ce{O3} precursors increase the concentration of particles with a diameter of less than 50 nm by 30\% but only increase the concentration of particles with a diameter above 50 nm by 4\%. As shown in Section \ref{sec:ch3:oxidation}, the \ce{O3} precursors affect only the \ce{SO2 + OH} reaction tendency which forms new sulfate aerosol particles. The \textit{piCH4} shows that the historical increase in \ce{CH4} leads to an increase in the aerosol concentration with a diameter above 1000 nm by 8\% after the 1970s; however, the concentration of aerosol at this size is negligible, with only 1-2 particles per cm${^3}$. More importantly, an increase in \ce{CH4} concentration decreases the aerosol concentration up to 300 nm diameter as the increase in \ce{CH4} decreases the \ce{SO2 + OH} reaction tendency which contributes to new aerosol formation. 

% add discussions on the results by O'Connor
This result agrees with other work which reported a change in aerosol size distribution due to \ce{CH4} \citep{oconnorApportionmentPreIndustrial2022}. They found that an increase in \ce{CH4} concentration in the present day leads to a significant reduction in aerosol number concentration in Aitken and accumulation mode. The reduction in N50 occurs across all latitudes and through the depths of the atmosphere. As \citet{oconnorApportionmentPreIndustrial2022} used timeslice simulations in their work, this work adds to their finding that the reduction in N50 occurs as early as the 1920s and increases in magnitude over time, to a maximum relative difference of 15\% in 2010. 

\subsection{Cloud properties}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Chapter3/Figs/f09_cloud-props.png}
    \caption{Change in annual mean (a) concentration of particles greater than 50 nm diameter (N50), (b) cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), (c) effective cloud droplet radius (R$_{\textrm{eff}}$) and (d) cloud fraction at 1 km. A 10-year rolling mean was applied to the data. Shaded areas denote the standard deviation from the 10-year mean.}
    \label{fig:ch3:cloud}
\end{figure}

Aerosols with a diameter above 50 nm (N50) act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in which their concentration modifies cloud properties. Figure \ref{fig:ch3:cloud} shows the global decadal mean N50 concentration as well as cloud properties including cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), cloud droplet effective radius (R$_{\textrm{eff}}$) and cloud fraction at 1 km. It shows that N50 rises from 400 cm$^{-3}$ in 1850 to 600 cm$^{-3}$ in the 1980s then decreases slightly in the historical period. This trend is in line with cloud properties change. \ce{O3} precursors are responsible for 12.5\% (75 cm$^{-3}$  of 600 cm$^{-3}$) of total N50 in 1980s. Meanwhile, an increase in N50 in \textit{piCH4} implies that historical anthropogenic methane emissions lower N50 concentration.

Cloud properties show signs of changes due to aerosol precursors and oxidant changes. Figure \ref{fig:ch3:cloud}b shows global mean cloud properties at 1 km above ground. CDNC increases by 40 cm$^{-3}$ due to aerosol precursors. Historical \ce{O3} precursors increase CDNC while \ce{CH4} decreases CDNC. This is linked to the change in \ce{SO2 + OH} reaction tendency as this reaction increases aerosol number in the atmosphere, which will affect CDNC \citep{twomeyInfluencePollutionShortwave1977}. While AOD, seen in figure \ref{fig:ch3:AOD-map}, does not indicate a significant change due to \ce{CH4}, cloud properties show a clear increase to CDNC and a decrease to R$_{\textrm{eff}}$. This is in line with work done by \citet{karsetStrongImpactsAerosol2018}, which found that the distribution of the changes in aerosol number concentration does not always correspond directly to the distribution of the changes in cloud and radiative properties. In essence, historical \ce{CH4} increases the cloud effective radius and decreases CDNC.

Cloud fraction increases by 0.2\% due to aerosol precursors. However, \ce{O3} and \ce{CH4} do not significantly alter cloud fractions as shown in \ref{fig:ch3:cloud}c. 


\subsection{Radiative effects due to SLCFs}

Greenhouse gases, aerosols, and clouds could perturb the Earth's radiative balance. One way to quantify the effect of each of the forcings is through the decomposition of effective radiative forcing (ERF) as described in Section \ref{sec:ch2:erf}. The ERF is decomposed into the clear and clean sky part or $ERF_{cs,clean}$, the instantaneous radiative forcing of the aerosol (ie, scattering and absorption) or aerosol IRF, and the cloud radiative effect or $\Delta$CRE'. Here we show that \ce{O3} precursors affect aerosol IRF and that \ce{CH4} affects the cloud radiative effect.

Figure \ref{fig:ch3:erf} shows the global annual mean aerosol ERF from aerosol precursors, \ce{O3} precursors and \ce{CH4}. Figure \ref{fig:ch3:erf}a shows that aerosol precursors contribute mostly to the cloud radiative effects (-1.01$\pm$0.19 W m$^{-2}$), followed by aerosol IRF (-0.18$\pm$0.04 W m$^{-2}$). Aerosol precursor ERF is the most negative between 1970-1990 due to an increase in both cloud radiative effect and instantaneous radiative forcing. Aerosol precursors include absorbing aerosols such as black carbons which contribute to net positive IRF in some regions such as eastern central China \citep{seoImpactsAerosolEmissions2020, oconnorAssessmentPreindustrialPresentday2021}. 


\ce{O3} is an important greenhouse gas \citep{forsterEarthEnergyBudget2021}. By itself, the present-day change in \ce{O3} has a positive (warming) clear-sky radiative forcing of 0.25 W m$^{-2}$ compared to 1850. There is a slight decrease in aerosol IRF due to \ce{O3} precursors starting in the 1960s and up to 0.08$\pm$0.05 W m$^{-2}$ between 2000-2014. This is due to the increase in new aerosol formation from the \ce{SO2 + OH} reaction tendency since the amount of scattered solar radiation is proportional to the total column mass burden of particles \citep{nemesureDirectShortwaveForcing1995}. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:ch3:AOD-map}, there is a statistically significant change to AOD due to \ce{O3} precursors. There is no clear change to cloud radiative effects due to \ce{O3}, consistent with \citet{skeieHistoricalTotalOzone2020}, who reported that cloud adjustments due to \ce{O3} are in the order of 0.02 W m$^{-2}$. However, we note that the UKESM1 is the only model with troposphere and stratosphere chemistry that gives negative ERF in the present-day \citet{skeieHistoricalTotalOzone2020}. 

\ce{CH4} is a greenhouse gas that also affects the cloud adjustment \citep{oconnorApportionmentPreIndustrial2022}. The increase in \ce{CH4} in the present-day has resulted in an increase in the clear-sky radiative forcing of 1.0 W m$^{-2}$ since 1850. Changes in \ce{CH4} since 1850 have resulted in negligible changes in the aerosol direct effect. This is due to the reaction tendency of \ce{SO2 + OH} and \ce{SO2 + H2O2} roughly cancelling out, resulting in an unchanged aerosol loading as shown in the aerosol AOD, figure \ref{fig:ch3:AOD-map}. On the other hand, the decrease to CDNC and increase in cloud droplet effective radius from 1850s to historical \ce{CH4} results in a positive cloud radiative effect of 0.21$\pm$0.15 W m$^{-2}$. These results agree with the time slice study reported in \citep{oconnorApportionmentPreIndustrial2022}.

% discuss oconnor in details
\citet{oconnorApportionmentPreIndustrial2022} showed that the increase in \ce{CH4} concentration leads to changes to aerosol properties, which leads to a positive total \ce{CH4} ERF. Their study used two timeslice experiments: pre-industrial and pre-industrial with present-day \ce{CH4} to calculate the aerosol ERF. The ERF estimates suggest that the total \ce{CH4} ERF from UKESM1 includes a significant indirect contribution from aerosols. The direct CH4 ERF at the present-day relative to the preindustrial period is 0.85$\pm$0.03 W m$^{-2}$ \citep{oconnorAssessmentPreindustrialPresentday2021}.

\section{Conclusions}

Changes in oxidants due to \ce{O3} precursors and \ce{CH4} affect sulfate aerosol formation, cloud formation and potentially radiative balance, but the impacts of oxidants on ERF are not well understood. In this work, we used results from AerChemMIP experiments to investigate the effects of oxidant changes on sulfate aerosol formation, aerosol and cloud properties and aerosol effective radiative forcing. We have explained the relationship between a net negative change to IRF by \ce{O3} and a net positive change by \ce{CH4} to CRE to changes in oxidation due to respective forcers.  

% Effects due to O3
Historical \ce{O3} precursor emissions increase \ce{O3} mixing ratio as well as \ce{OH} and \ce{H2O2}. These oxidant increases enhance the \ce{SO2 + OH} reaction tendency and significantly increase the aerosol AOD near high \ce{SO2} emission regions.  Due to \ce{O3} precursors, the concentration of aerosols with size below 50 nm increases, which increases the cloud droplet number concentration but does not result in significant changes in cloud radiative effects. Ultimately, ozone precursors increase the aerosol instantaneous radiative forcing by up to 0.08$\pm$0.05 W m$^{-2}$ between 2000-2014, which is 44\% of aerosol IRF due to aerosol precursors, further cooling the climate.

% Effects due to CH4
On the other hand, \ce{CH4} decreases the OH concentration as \ce{CH4} acts as an OH sink. Increases in \ce{CH4} also increases \ce{H2O2} and \ce{O3} mixing ratios. These changes in oxidants decrease the OH reaction tendency (\ce{SO2 + OH}) but increase the \ce{SO2 + H2O2} reaction tendency, resulting in an unchanged sulfate budget but a larger mean aerosol diameter as the \ce{H2O2} oxidation occurs in the liquid phase where aerosol growth occurs more easily. This change in aerosol size distribution minimises CDNC and enhances the effective cloud droplet radius. As a result,\ce{CH4} contributes to a positive cloud radiative effect of 0.21$\pm$0.15 W m$^{-2}$ between 2000-2014, further adding to the warming impact of methane on the climate.

Changes in aerosol precursor emissions have had an important impact on the climate offsetting a significant fraction of the warming from long-lived greenhouse gases \citep{szopaShortlivedClimateForcers2021}. However, we have shown here that accounting for oxidants over the historical period is important to accurately simulate sulfate aerosol formation and the resulting aerosol radiative effects. Up to 40\% of the change in aerosol direct radiative may be the result if ERF is calculated using oxidant from the present day.
