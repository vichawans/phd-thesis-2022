I would like to express my gratitude to Dr Paul Griffths and Prof Alexander Archibald for their insights, advice, patience, and guidance. I would like to thank Dr Luke Abraham, Zosia Staniaszek and all CAS members for welcoming me into the group and for both academic and technical advice. I would like to thank the Cambridge Thai Foundation and Cambridge Trust for funding. Finally, I am grateful for my friends at St Edmund’s College and my family for their unwavering support.


This part of the thesis is the one that I was most looking forward to writing.

For all that Paul has done to shape me into the person and the scientist that I am today, ‘thank you’ seems so embarrassingly simple and utterly inadequate to convey the depth of my gratitude to him. I truly hope I have done him proud.
